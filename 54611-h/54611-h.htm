<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p>Interest in mental disorders is no longer confined to
the relatively small number of persons whose duties or
family ties bring them into daily contact with the mentally
ill. Disorders that so profoundly affect human conduct
were certain, sooner or later, to attract the attention of
those who are interested in the study of human behavior
in its broadest relations or who have special responsibilities
with reference to the conduct of individuals and
require all the information that they can secure on
factors that modify the reactions of men, women or children
in the social environments in which they live and
die. Uncertain of themselves until they made sure of
the sciences upon which their future work was to develop,
social workers since the commencement of organized
social work in this country demanded of the sciences concerned
with the human mind some information that
might aid them in dealing with the difficult problems in
human adaptation which they found constituted the chief
part of social work. Judges and those who are interested
in penology have within recent years turned also
to the students of abnormal human behavior for light
upon problems of crime and delinquency. With mental
hygiene becoming firmly established as a practical field
of preventive medicine, another group of persons not
directly concerned with the care of the mentally ill has
become deeply interested in the forms, types and causes
of mental illness. It is by such readers, quite as much
as physicians, medical students and nurses, that Dr.
May's work in bringing together the main facts regarding
mental diseases and the people who suffer from them
will be appreciated. For those whose interest in the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
is incidental and not part of a life-long study, the
information here presented will be of special value.
There are, it is true, many technical works on mental
diseases in their medical, social and legal relations, but
it is doubtful whether elsewhere there can be found in a
single volume as much varied information as that which
Dr. May has brought together.</p>

<p>There is probably no group of diseases about which
there is such widespread popular ignorance or misinformation
as those that affect the mind. People who
would be ashamed not to have accurate information
regarding the more important infectious diseases and
more than general knowledge of the means by which they
are transmitted speak of "insanity" as if there were a
single disorder to which that name could properly be
applied, and are without the slightest knowledge of the
different forms of mental diseases, the periods of life in
which they appear, their main characteristics and the
means by which they terminate. Statistics relating even
to those persons with mental disorders who are cared for
in special institutions are usually quite unfamiliar to
persons who have more than an ordinary amount of information
regarding the prevalence of other diseases.
Such a book as this will go far toward supplying the
extraordinary lack of knowledge of conditions that have
exceedingly important social and economic relations and
from the study of which many lessons can be drawn that
are applicable to human affairs far removed from those
relating to patients in our hospitals for the insane.</p>

<h2 id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>In presenting a preliminary consideration of the subject
of mental diseases as a public health problem the
author is actuated by no other motive than that of stimulating
the undertaking, at some future time, of a comprehensive
investigation and survey of an important
field which has never been systematically and adequately
studied in the past. Under existing circumstances the
facts necessary for an intelligent discussion of this question
are unfortunately not obtainable. We have, as will
be shown, practically no information whatever as to the
incidence of mental diseases in the community. Hospital
statistics are still in such a chaotic state that we
are not even in a position to speak authoritatively of
that part of the population which is entirely within our
supervision and control in institutions. Before any progress
can be hoped for we must at least have at our
disposal accurate data relative to the patients within
the walls of our hospitals. This presupposes a uniform
scheme of statistical reports based upon some common
viewpoint. Adequate preparations for this undertaking
have been made by the American Psychiatric Association
and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene.
Every hospital for mental diseases in the country has
been urged to cooperate in this movement. To show the
necessity for more actively prosecuting this research has
been one of the principal purposes of this book.</p>

<p>In elaborating somewhat briefly the conception of the
various psychoses generally accepted by American psychiatrists,
and for that reason included in the classification
adopted by the Association, every effort has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
made, as far as possible, to show the steps which have
led up to present developments. The author has endeavored
to confine himself to reflecting the views of others
throughout and has used actual quotations from recognized
authorities as far as was deemed advisable. In
the discussion of the various psychoses frequent references
will be noted to the description of the various
clinical groups contained in the manual prepared by the
Committee on Statistics for the American Psychiatric
Association. As is shown in the manual, these definitions
and explanatory notes were formulated by Dr. George H.
Kirby.</p>

<p>Special reference should be made to the important
contributions to the literature of psychiatry of such well-known
American writers as Meyer, Hoch, Kirby, White,
Barrett, Campbell, Southard, Peterson, Diefendorf, Jelliffe,
Paton, Salmon, Russell, Buckley, Rosanoff, Orton,
Singer and many others. The work of Kraepelin, Bleuler,
Nissl, Alzheimer, Freud, Jung, Stekel, Janet and
others abroad has exercised an influence on the psychiatry
of the day which must be recognized. We are very
largely indebted to Pollock and to Furbush for the available
information relating to the incidence of the various
psychoses in this country. To the American Psychiatric,
for many years the American Medico-Psychological,
Association we owe an exhaustive historical review of
the institutional care and treatment of mental diseases in
the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>Obviously this work was not intended as a textbook,
nor was it designed to serve the purpose of one. It is
an appeal to those who are already familiar with the
fundamental principles of psychiatry. For that reason
the interpretation of mental mechanisms given so much
space in textbooks has been entirely omitted and no
reference is made to the treatment of the individual
psychoses. Such reliable statistical data as could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
gathered from recent hospital reports and publications
have been utilized in full. The following institutions
were represented in this study:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montana</span>&mdash;Montana State Hospital, Warm Springs, 1917 and

<p><span class="smcap">New Jersey</span>&mdash;Essex County Hospital, Overbrook, 1918.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pennsylvania</span>&mdash;State Hospital Southeastern District of

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span>&mdash;Vermont State Hospital, Waterbury, 1917 and
1918.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia</span>&mdash;Central State Hospital, Petersburg, 1919; Western
State Hospital, Staunton, 1919.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span>&mdash;Eastern State Hospital, Medical Lake, 1917

<p><span class="smcap">West Virginia</span>&mdash;Spencer State Hospital, 1917 and 1918; Weston
State Hospital, Weston, 1917 and 1918.</p>

<p class="p1f">These institutions may, I think, be looked upon as
fairly representative of the hospitals of this country.
Based on their official reports an analysis has been made
of over seventy thousand consecutive first admissions.</p>

<p>There is no disposition on the part of the writer to
overestimate the value of statistical studies. Our conclusions
should, however, be based as fully as possible
on facts rather than on abstract theories or individual
observations alone. The social, economic and clinical
aspects of mental diseases must all be given adequate
consideration if psychiatry is to fulfill its obligation to
the community and assume a dignified rôle in the advancement
of modern medicine.</p>

<span class="st">THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p1e">The importance of mental diseases as a factor in the
social and economic welfare of the community has not
been given adequate consideration, notwithstanding the
remarkable progress of modern psychiatry. Nor is this
influence, unfortunately, one which can be easily estimated
or accurately determined. We have, as a matter
of fact, no data at hand to show the prevalence of disease,
either physical or mental, with any degree of exactness
even under our most elaborately organized forms of
government. There is no complete information available
which will enable us to determine the frequency of
such important conditions as appendicitis, cardiac or
renal diseases, peritonitis, septic infections, diseases of
the eye, ear, skin or nervous system. It is true that
there are, in the majority of states, records of contagious
or readily communicable diseases which are probably
fairly reliable. Aside from this, the only information at
our disposal is confined to mortality statistics.</p>

<p>This suggests a further consideration of the advisability,
if not absolute necessity, of more extensive statistical
studies of diseases, both mental and physical, if the
welfare of the community is to be safeguarded and the
future of medical science assured. Every physician
should be required by law to make careful reports to the
Board of Health of his state showing all medical conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
requiring treatment by him or coming to his professional
notice. The value of such information to
medical science would much more than compensate for
the comparatively small cost of such an undertaking.
Nor is this procedure more radical either in theory or
practice than was the proposal to report all communicable
diseases only a few years since. The data thus made
available in the various states should be correlated and
published by the Public Health Service.</p>

<p>The mortality statistics of the United States Census
Bureau furnish us with a valuable index of the relative
frequency of the various disease processes which determine
the death rate of the community. They are based
on the transcripts of death certificates received from the
so-called registration area, which in 1920 had an estimated
population of 87,486,713. The total number of
deaths reported in 1920 was 1,142,558, a rate of 13.1 per
1,000 of the population. It is true that the epidemic
of influenza was still a factor of some importance at that
time. The rate for 1916, however, was fourteen, for
1917 fourteen and two-tenths, for 1918 eighteen and one-tenth
and for 1919 twelve and nine-tenths per 1,000 of
the population. The registration area now includes
thirty-four states:&mdash;California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington
and Wisconsin. It is interesting, at least, to note the
states not included in the registration <span class="no-break">area:&mdash;</span>Alabama,
Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas,
West Virginia and Wyoming. The results obtained from
a study of the reports from such an extensive district
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
must be looked upon as thoroughly representative of the
country at large. The last complete statistics available
are those for 1920. Influenza was still an important factor
at that time, it being responsible for a death rate of
71 per 100,000. The influenza rate was 98.8 in 1919,
302.1 in 1918, 17.3 in 1917, 26.5 in 1916, 16 in 1915, 9.1 in
1914 and 10.3 in 1912.</p>

<p>The important causes of death in 1920 were as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">We may, therefore, reasonably conclude that there
was an average number of at least 19.36 per 100,000
(from 1906 to 1910 this amounted to 32.1) in which the
primary cause of death was associated with mental diseases,
an exceedingly conservative estimate. This does
not take into consideration the deaths due to senility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
(15.5) or suicide (12.8), conditions which might very logically
be included for obvious reasons. It is, of course,
well known that the psychoses rarely, if ever, appear in
the death certificates as a primary cause of death. As
a matter of fact, they are not always shown in the secondary
causes. Information on this subject is still less
satisfactory from a statistical point of view. During the
year 1917 (contributory causes have not been reported
since that year) there was a total of 1,066,711 primary
causes of death shown in the registration area and only
372,291 contributory causes. Of this number the following
may be classified as having been associated with
psychoses:</p>

<p class="p2">The contributory causes definitely showing mental
diseases constitute only 3.4 per cent of the whole number,
and the death rate for 1917, including both primary and
contributory causes suggestive of probable psychoses,
was 37.2 per 100,000. This would indicate that the number
of deaths from mental diseases shown in the primary
causes represents only about fifty-three per cent of all
mental cases which are actual factors in determining the
death rate of the community. A comparison of these figures
with the number of cases dying in hospitals shows
that they cannot be looked upon as determining the percentage
of the general population showing psychoses.
Of the 1,952 persons dying in the institutions for mental
diseases in Massachusetts in 1919, approximately nineteen
per cent showed the psychoses in the primary causes
of death. This percentage would probably be fairly constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

recognized fact that the death certificate at best is not
beyond suspicion and does not furnish information regarding
the cause of death which can be accepted without
question.</p>

<p class="p2">It must be admitted that Cabot's findings are discouraging.
They are not so bad as they would seem, however,
at first thought. Death certificates, unfortunately, do
not have the significance which they should have. Physicians
are well known to be entirely too careless in their
preparation and inclined to look upon them merely as
legal formalities which cannot readily be avoided. It is
furthermore difficult, as every doctor knows, to point to
one immediate primary cause of death in every instance.
Very often there is a combination of factors concerned
and it is possible at practically every autopsy to find
lesions not represented in any way whatever in the death
certificate. It is unquestionably true that statistics of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
any kind must be based on information some of which
we know to be inaccurate. This should not be used as an
argument for discontinuing, absolutely, our search for
knowledge. It is merely a reason why our clinical standards
should be improved.</p>

<p class="p2b">An exceedingly important contribution to our rather
limited fund of accurate information regarding the general
health of the country was the publication recently
issued by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
on the mortality statistics of wage earners and their
families. This covers a period of six years (1911 to
1916) and represents a study of 635,449 deaths. The
cases reported came from every state in the union with
the following exceptions: Mississippi, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas, Nevada, Arizona
and New Mexico. Canada and many other localities
outside of the "Registration Area" of the United
States Census Bureau were included. The facts presented
in this report are unique in that they render
available for the first time a careful and detailed consideration
of the diseases which may be looked upon as representative
of the industrial population of the country.
The various occupations shown in the order of their
numerical importance were as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>Laborers, teamsters,
drivers and chauffeurs, machinists, textile mill
operatives, clerks, office assistants, etc. It covers a study
of ten million policy holders and nearly fifty-four million
years of life in the aggregate. The age groups
studied range from one year to seventy-five in ratios not
very different from those exhibited in the general population.
The death rate for all persons exposed was 11.81
per 1,000 as compared with a rate of over thirteen per

our disposal relative to the incidence of general diseases
in the community is the tabulation of communicable diseases
by Boards of Heath. The annual report of the
United States Public Health Service for 1919 shows a
case rate for diphtheria of 137 per 100,000 of the population
based on the reports of thirty-seven states. The case
rate for measles in thirty-seven states was 170. Poliomyelitis
in thirty states showed a rate of 2.5 and
scarlet fever a rate of 110 in thirty-seven states. The
smallpox rate was sixty-eight and represented thirty-six
states. The typhoid fever rate for thirty-seven states
was only forty. The case rate for tuberculosis, all
forms, was 346.7 in 1918. It was 274.2 in New York,
271.6 in the District of Columbia and 271.3 in New Jersey.
These were the highest reported in the United
States during that year. Unfortunately these statistics
relate to communicable diseases only. This difficulty is
due largely to the fact that comparatively few states have
made attempts to keep elaborate records. The reports
of Massachusetts are probably as comprehensive as any.
The case rate per 100,000 of the population of all reportable
diseases during the year 1920 was as follows:</p>

The case rates for influenza and pneumonia cannot be
looked upon as representative, owing to the epidemic of
1919 and 1920. During 1917 the death rate from influenza
was 12.9 per 100,000 and from pneumonia 163.8.
The death rate from heart diseases (organic diseases of
the heart and endocarditis) in Massachusetts in 1920 was
178 per 100,000 of the population, from apoplexy 108.4,
cancer and other malignant diseases 116.7, Bright's
disease and nephritis 92.4, diarrhea and enteritis 52.9,
violence 76.3, automobile accidents and injuries 11.9 and
suicides 10.1.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that it is exceedingly difficult to
establish a definite basis for a comparison of our statistics
relating to mental disorders and those dealing with
the frequency of other diseases in the community. As
has been shown, our information on the latter subject,
such as it is, has to do only with communicable diseases
and the reported death rates. In making an analysis of
the reports of mental diseases we are limited almost
entirely to the institution population. It is true that
these statistics are much more reliable than the others,
as we are dealing with a stable population entirely under
control. The cases, furthermore, are almost invariably
subject to a prolonged observation and careful study.
The diagnosis in almost every instance is based on elaborate
mental examinations and exhaustive personal and
family histories. It is, of course, true that there are
innumerable cases of mental diseases outside of institutions.
There were 18,268 patients at home on visit from
the state hospitals alone on January 1, 1920. Those not
requiring hospital treatment or custody in an institution
can, however, be eliminated for the purpose of comparative
studies. The fact that an analysis of death rates
alone does not throw any light whatever on the frequence
of psychoses for reasons already given will, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
think, be conceded. For statistical purposes, at least, it
may be assumed that the frequence of mental diseases
as shown by a study of the hospital population is fairly
representative of conditions existing in the community.</p>

<p class="p2b">For purposes of comparison we may contrast the
admission rate of mental diseases per 100,000 of the
population in Massachusetts in 1920 with the case rate
of communicable diseases as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">The total institution population (mental cases) at the
end of the year 1920 represented a rate of 395.49 per
100,000 of the population. It should be borne in mind
that, with the exception of tuberculosis and syphilis, the
communicable diseases reported above represent, as
a rule, the total number of cases in the state during the
year. Comparative studies should, therefore, be based not
on the number of mental cases in the hospitals at any
one given time, but on the total number under treatment
during the year. This would indicate <em>an incidence of
mental diseases of 566.98 per 100,000 of the population</em>.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1916, there were 147 state and federal
institutions for the care and treatment of mental diseases
in the United States, as shown by the Census
Bureau reports. There were at this same time twenty-seven
institutions for the feebleminded, nine for epileptics,
three for inebriates, forty-five for tuberculosis,
twenty-eight for the blind, thirty-three for the deaf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
twelve for the blind and deaf and eighty-four for the
dependent classes.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The appropriations for the maintenance of these institutions
for 1915 amounted to $33,557,058.29. This
constituted 7.6 per cent of the appropriations made by
those states for all purposes. In Massachusetts it represented
14.8 per cent, in New Hampshire 10.1, in New
York 12.7, in Ohio 12, in Indiana 10.7, in Illinois 13.4,
and in a number of other states over ten per cent of the
appropriations for all purposes. It was equivalent to an
average of $431.16 per million of the total assessed valuation
of these states. In Massachusetts it was as high
as $653.62 and in New York $567.37. This means thirty-three
cents per capita for all states, eighty-four cents for
Massachusetts and sixty-eight cents for New York.</p>

<p>The actual expenditure for the maintenance of these
institutions was $36,312,662.20. For purposes of comparison,
attention should be called to the fact that the
maintenance of the tuberculosis hospitals of the United
States for the same year cost $3,539,454.95, institutions
for criminals $21,244,892.00, for the feebleminded
$3,341,442.85, for epileptics $1,345,821.57, for the blind
$1,066,973.14, for the deaf $1,893,490.09 and for the
dependent classes $9,675,932.37.</p>

<p>The value of the property invested in the state and
federal hospitals for mental diseases in 1916 was estimated
at $187,028,728.00. The valuation of these institutions
per 100,000 of the population was $184,795.81. This
does not include establishments for mental defectives.
The average value per patient was $938.43. In Massachusetts
it was $1,097.85 and in New York $1,039.85. In
Arkansas it was as high as $2,264.00. The total acreage
of land was 109,503.2, an average of 744.9 acres per hospital.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
There were 33,124 persons employed, an average
of 226.9 for each institution. This represented one
employee for every six patients.</p>

<p>The census taken by the National Committee for
Mental Hygiene<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in 1920 shows 156 state hospitals
for mental diseases, two federal institutions, 125 county
or city hospitals and twenty-one institutions of a temporary
care type. In the public and private hospitals
for mental diseases on January 1, 1920, there were 232,680
patients under treatment. Of these, 200,109 were in
public and 9,238 in private hospitals. This represented
an increase of 8,723 in two years. It is interesting to
note that city and county institutions cared for 21,584
persons.</p>

<p>The first authoritative information relative to the
institution care of mental diseases was obtained from
the federal census reports of 1880. In that year there
were 40,942 patients in the public hospitals. In 1890
there were 74,028; in 1904, 150,151; in 1910, 187,791; in
1917, 232,873 and in 1918, 239,820. The rate per 100,000
of the population increased from 81.6 in 1880 to 229.6 in
1918. From 1910 to 1918 the general population increased
13.6 per cent and the hospital population 27.7
per cent. The rate per 100,000 of the population in institutions
in Massachusetts<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on January 1, 1920, was
373.8, in New York 374.6, in Connecticut 317.8, in Iowa
248.1, in Wisconsin 300.6, in California 297.2, in Pennsylvania
215.2, in Ohio 212.1, in Illinois 229.5 and in
Michigan 210.8. The admission rate per 100,000 of the
population in 1917 was 151.6 in Massachusetts, 109.2 in
Illinois, 124.8 in Montana, 97.3 in New York, 80.9 in Connecticut
and 85.7 in California.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The cost of maintenance in the state hospitals increased
to $43,926,888.88 in 1917 with an average per
capita cost of $207.28. The number of cases cared for
in some of the more populous states is of interest. On
January 1, 1920, the institution population of New York
was 38,903, Pennsylvania 18,764, Ohio 12,217, Illinois
14,884, Massachusetts 14,399 and California 10,184.</p>

<p>Based on the estimated population of Massachusetts
on July 1, 1920 (3,869,098), the 1,475 deaths in institutions
for mental diseases would represent a death rate of
38.12 per 100,000 of the population. The death rate for
other diseases for that year was: diphtheria 15.4,
measles 9.0, pulmonary tuberculosis 96.7, typhoid fever
2.5, whooping cough 14.0, scarlet fever 5.5, syphilis
5.8, lobar pneumonia 71.9 and influenza 43.9. The importance
to be attached, however, to such comparisons is
very uncertain at best. From the standpoint of social
and economic importance to the community there is another
factor under consideration which should not be
overlooked. The duration of other diseases, as a general
rule, is comparatively short. A study of over ten
thousand deaths in New York state hospitals for mental
diseases shows the average hospital residence of these
cases to have been over six years. At the rate of admission
to public institutions for 1917 (62,898) and the average
per capita cost for that year ($207.28) the care of
persons admitted annually, during their years of hospital
life, would mean an expenditure of over seventy-eight
millions of dollars.</p>

<p>If we figured the earning capacity of the 62,000 persons
admitted to institutions for mental diseases in the
United States as averaging only one thousand dollars
per year, it would represent an economic loss to the country
of sixty-two millions of dollars annually. Estimated
in the same way, the total population of the hospitals
would represent the staggering sum of nearly two hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and forty million dollars. This, of course, does not
take into consideration at all the cost of maintenance or
the property investment represented by hospitals.</p>

<p>To avoid any possibility of confusion, no reference
has been made heretofore to statistical studies of mental
deficiency or epilepsy. From a public health point of
view, however, and as social and economic problems, they
are questions which cannot be disregarded in a consideration
of mental diseases. As a matter of fact, they
are very closely correlated in many ways. A survey
made by the National Committee for Mental Hygiene
shows that on January 1, 1920, there were in this country
thirty-two state institutions for mental defectives, eleven
admitting both feebleminded and epileptics and twenty
exclusively for the latter class.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In addition to this,
one city institution was reported. Of the private hospitals
twenty-seven care for the feebleminded only, and
six for epileptics, while nineteen admit either of these
classes. The total number of mental defectives in institutions
on January 1, 1920, was 40,519. At that time
34,836 were in state, 2,732 in other public institutions and
2,951 in private hospitals. In the following states they
are cared for in hospitals for mental diseases, no other
provisions having been made for their treatment:&mdash;Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and
West Virgina. The states reporting the largest number
are New York 5,762, Pennsylvania 4,281, Massachusetts
3,192, Illinois 3,147, Ohio 2,435, Michigan 1,849, Iowa
1,704, New Jersey 1,762, Wisconsin 1,624, Minnesota
1,502, Indiana 1,264 and Missouri 1,047. At the same
time there were 14,937 epileptics under treatment, 13,223
in state, 859 in other public institutions and 855 in private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hospitals. Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Nebraska,
New Mexico and Washington take care of the epileptics
in their hospitals for mental diseases. The intimate
relation between mental diseases and epilepsy is shown
by the fact that as nearly as can be determined at this
time approximately thirty per cent of all of the epileptics
in our state institutions have been committed as
insane. This, however, nowhere nearly includes all of
the cases which actually show mental disorders of one
kind or another. The states showing the largest numbers
of epileptics are New York with 1,683, Ohio 1,680 and
Massachusetts 1,227. No other states report over one
thousand, although Michigan and Pennsylvania have
over eight hundred and Illinois and Missouri over seven
hundred.</p>

<p>Although the incidence of mental as compared with
other diseases prevalent in the community cannot be
established with absolute accuracy, sufficient evidence
has been presented to warrant the statement that from
the standpoint of the public health we are dealing with
no other problem of equal importance today. The state
care of mental defects, epilepsy, tuberculosis and the
deaf, dumb and blind is, for various reasons, of much less
consequence to the community than the hospital treatment
of mental diseases. The defective, delinquent,
criminal and dependent classes combined do not equal
in number the population housed in our state hospitals
for mental diseases. Nor does the number of cases cared
for in the general hospitals of the state, county or municipal
type compare in any way with the mental cases
coming under state or federal supervision. It can, I
think, be said without any fear of contradiction that no
other disease or group of diseases is of equal importance
from a social or economic point of view. Perhaps
nothing emphasizes this fact more strongly than the
report recently issued from the Surgeon General's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
office relative to the second examination of the first million
recruits drafted in 1917. Twelve per cent of these
were rejected on account of nervous or mental diseases.
The number disqualified for service finally reached a
total of over sixty-seven thousand.</p>

<p>Mental integrity is now looked upon as a military
necessity and is insisted upon as one of the important
requirements of the soldier. It has been demonstrated
conclusively that only men of the most stable mental
equilibrium can withstand the stress and strain of modern
methods of warfare. Nor are peacetime requirements
any less exacting. In commercial competition the
law of the survival of the fittest is practically absolute.
The feebleminded often inherit wealth, but they rarely
acquire it. Vaccination for the prevention of smallpox
is compulsory and the isolation of communicable diseases
dangerous to the public welfare is rigidly enforced.
At the same time we allow many paranoics the freedom
of the country and they occasionally assassinate a President.
Psychopaths are not infrequently elected to public
office and epileptics are not disqualified from driving
high-powered and dangerous motor vehicles. The engineers
of our fastest trains must not be color blind,
but they occasionally are victims of the most fatal of
all mental diseases,&mdash;general paresis. The navigating
officer of a transatlantic liner, responsible for the lives of
hundreds of passengers, must pass an examination for a
license, but he may be dominated by delusions which
escape observation because they are not looked for. Important
trials, where human lives were at stake, have
been presided over by insane judges. Army officers in
command of troops in time of war have been influenced
by imaginary voices. Insurance companies issue large
policies to individuals suffering from incipient mental
diseases which could be detected by even a superficial
psychiatric examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Serious consideration should be given to the advisability
of subjecting to a careful mental examination such
persons, at least, as are to be charged with an entire
responsibility for the lives of others. It is a question as
to whether this procedure is not indicated in the case of
other important public trusts where the interest of the
community should be safeguarded.</p>

<p>The correlation of psychiatry and psychology as
scientific aids to industrial efficiency promises to open
up entirely new and important sociological fields of research
which have only recently attracted attention.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
This is a subject of far reaching importance. The extent
to which the industrial classes of the country are
affected is shown by the following analysis of the occupations
represented by 104,013 admissions to New York
state hospitals: 1. Professional&mdash;(clergy, military and
naval officers, physicians, lawyers, architects, artists,
authors, civil engineers, surveyors, etc.) 1,926 or 1.8 per
cent; 2. Commercial&mdash;(bankers, merchants, accountants,
clerks, salesmen, shopkeepers, shopmen, stenographers,
typewriters, etc.) 7,572 or 7.2 per cent; 3. Agricultural&mdash;(farmers,
gardeners, etc.) 5,942 or 5.7 per cent; 4. Mechanics&mdash;at
Outdoor Vocations&mdash;(blacksmiths, carpenters,
enginefitters, sawyers, painters, etc.) 8,564 or 8.2
per cent; 5. Mechanics at Sedentary Vocations&mdash;(bootmakers,
bookbinders, compositors, tailors, weavers,
bakers, etc.) 7,501 or 7.2 per cent; 6. Domestic Service&mdash;(waiters,
cooks, servants, etc.) 21,037 or 20.2 per cent;
7. Educational and Higher Domestic Duties&mdash;(governesses,
teachers, students, housekeepers, nurses, etc.)
21,861 or 21 per cent; 8. Commercial&mdash;(shopkeepers,
saleswomen, stenographers, typewriters, etc.) 1,140 or
1.09 per cent; 9. Employed at Sedentary Occupations&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
(tailoresses, seamstresses, bookbinders, factory workers,
etc.) 4,310 or 4.1 per cent; 10. Miners, Seamen, etc., 581
or .56 per cent; 11. Prostitutes, 81 or .08 per cent; 12.
Laborers, 12,962 or 12.4 per cent; No occupation, 7,820 or
7.5 per cent; Unascertained, 2,715 or 2.6 per cent.
<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
This certainly indicates an enormous economic loss to the
community.</p>

<p>The intimate relation between mental diseases, alcoholism,
ignorance, poverty, prostitution, criminality,
mental defects, etc., suggests social and economic problems
of far reaching importance, each one meriting separate
and special consideration. These problems, while
perhaps essentially sociological in origin, have at the
same time an important educational bearing, invade the
realm of psychology and depend largely, if not entirely,
upon psychiatry for a solution.</p>

<span class="st">THE EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN HOSPITAL</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p2">The medical treatment of mental diseases had its inception,
in this country, in the wards of the Philadelphia
Hospital, established in 1732 and referred to officially
for over a century as an almshouse. It included an infirmary
for the "sick and insane," although it apparently
had no distinct and separate hospital department
for many years. "In 1742," to use the words of Dr. D.
Hayes Agnew, "it was fulfilling a varied routine of
beneficent functions in affording shelter, support and employment
for the poor and indigent, a hospital for the
sick, and an asylum for the idiotic, the insane and the
orphan. It was dispensing its acts of mercy and blessing
when Pennsylvania was yet a province and her inhabitants
the loyal subjects of Great Britain." In 1772 it
housed as many as three hundred and fifty persons. In
1769 the General Assembly passed an act authorizing the
"Managers of the Contributions for the Relief and Employment
of the Poor," who had charge of the almshouse,
to issue bills of credit for the purpose of relieving their
indebtedness. This paper currency was issued in three
denominations&mdash;one shilling, two shillings and a half
crown. The law provided that counterfeiters or persons
altering the denomination of these bills should be "sentenced
to the pillory, have both his or her ears cut off and
nailed to the pillory and be publicly whipped on his or
her back with thirty-nine lashes, well laid on, and, moreover,
every such offender shall forfeit the sum of one
hundred pounds, to be levied on his or her land, tenements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
goods and chattels."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This certainly must have
discouraged counterfeiting. It was not until after the
institution was removed to the Hamilton estate in
Blockley (now a part of West Philadelphia) in 1834 that
it came to be known as the "Philadelphia Hospital and
Almshouse," although there was no change made in its
organization or functions. In 1902, after one hundred
and seventy years of continuous existence, it was finally
divided officially for administrative purposes into The
Philadelphia Home or Hospital for the Indigent, The
Philadelphia General Hospital and The Philadelphia
Hospital for the Insane. At that time the hospital was,
as it is today, the largest on the American continent.
The institution, which has admitted mental cases uninterruptedly
since 1732, had over seventeen hundred patients
in the department for the insane. In 1917 this
number had increased to nearly three thousand.</p>

<p>One of the reasons set forth by sundry petitioners in
1751 for a "small Provincial Hospital" in Philadelphia,
which at that time had made provision for the care of
indigent cases only, was "THAT with the Numbers of
People, the Number of Lunaticks or Persons distempered
in Mind and deprived of their rational Faculties, hath
greatly increased in this Province. That some of them
going at large are a Terror to their Neighbours, who are
daily apprehensive of the Violences they may commit;
And others are continually wasting their Substance, to
the great Injury of themselves and Families, ill disposed
Persons wickedly taking Advantage of their unhappy
Condition, and drawing them into unreasonable Bargains,
etc. That few or none of them are so sensible of
their Condition, as to submit voluntarily to the Treatment
their respective Cases require, and therefore continue
in the same deplorable State during their Lives;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
whereas it has been found, by the Experience of many
Years, that above two Thirds of the Mad People received
into Bethlehem Hospital, and there treated properly, have
been perfectly cured."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This resulted eventually in
the opening of the Pennsylvania Hospital in 1752. This
institution is a general hospital supported by private
funds and has always received mental cases. A separate
department for mental diseases was established in West
Philadelphia in 1841. Before this was done considerable
difficulty was experienced on account of the annoyance
of the patients by curious-minded citizens of the neighborhood.
This developed into such a nuisance in 1760
that it was suggested "That a suitable Pallisade Fence,
either of Iron or Wood, the Iron being preferred, shall
be erected in Order to prevent the Disturbance which
is given to the Lunatics confined in the Cells by the great
Number of People who frequently resort and converse
with them."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It was also deemed advisable to employ
"Two Constables or other proper Persons, to attend at
such times as are necessary to prevent this Inconvenience
until ye Fence is erected." The public was notified later
"that such persons who come out of curiosity to visit
the house should pay a sum of money, a Groat at least,
for admittance."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Pennsylvania Hospital has
played a very important part in the history of the care
and treatment of mental diseases in this country. In
1919 it had over three hundred patients.</p>

<p>The first institution designed and used exclusively for
mental diseases in this country was the Eastern State
Hospital at Williamsburg, Virginia. It was incorporated
by the House of Burgesses in 1768 and opened for patients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on October 12, 1773. It is interesting to note that
the act of incorporation, except in the title, makes no use
of the word lunatic, refers frequently to the care and
treatment of the patients, authorizes the appointment of
physicians and nurses, and specifically designates the
institution as a hospital and not an asylum. The original
building was one hundred feet long by thirty-two
feet two inches wide. During the first year thirty-six
patients were admitted. The first pay patient was received
in 1774 at a rate of fifteen pounds per annum. An
allowance of twenty-five pounds per year was made by
the legislature for the maintenance and support of each
person admitted. Visiting physicians prescribed for the
patients, and the "keepers" for the first few years were
not graduates in medicine. The superintendents were,
however, physicians after 1841. Known for many years
as the "Publick Hospital," the legislature made the mistake
of changing this designation to The Eastern Lunatic
Asylum in 1841 and it was not until 1894 that it again
officially became a hospital. Virginia opened its second
institution, The Western State Hospital for the Insane,
at Staunton on July 25, 1828. Its third hospital was
opened at Weston on September 9, 1859. Virginia is thus
entitled to the credit of being the first commonwealth to
furnish state care for mental cases and make adequate
provision for them.</p>

<p>The next step in the evolution of hospital treatment
of mental diseases was taken by Maryland in incorporating
a hospital for "The Relief of Indigent Sick Persons
and for the Reception and Care of Lunatics" in 1797.
The hospital was formally opened in 1798 under the management
of the city of Baltimore, which leased the establishment
in 1808 to two physicians, who conducted it as a
private institution until 1834. It then reverted to the
state and was operated as the Maryland Hospital. The
institution was removed to Catonsville in 1872 and is<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
now known as the Spring Grove State Hospital, the
Johns Hopkins Hospital occupying the site of the original
building in Baltimore. Another interesting event
in the history of this institution was the founding of
what subsequently became the Mount Hope Retreat by
the Sisters of Charity, who withdrew from the Maryland
Hospital in 1840.</p>

<p>The earliest hospital care of mental diseases in New
York was in the wards of the New York Hospital which
was opened in 1791. A separate building for mental
cases was ready for the reception of patients in 1808.
The total number of cases treated up to July 1820 was
1,553. The Bloomingdale Asylum replaced this in 1821,
on a piece of property which now belongs in part to
Columbia University. Public patients were cared for at
the expense of the state until the opening of the New
York City Asylum in 1839. Church services were inaugurated
in 1819. The hospital buildings furnished accommodations
for about three hundred patients. In 1894
the property on Bloomingdale Road was abandoned and
the hospital removed to White Plains in Westchester
County. It is still known as the Bloomingdale Hospital
and is supported entirely by public contributions and
the income derived from the care of patients. It has
about three hundred and fifty beds.</p>

<p>The activities of the "Religious Society of Friends,"
which were indirectly responsible probably for the inception
of the Pennsylvania Hospital, ultimately led to the
establishment of the Friends' Asylum for the Insane at
Frankford, Pennsylvania, in 1817. It was under sectarian
control until 1834, when its doors were thrown
open to all, without regard to religious belief. It claims
to be the first institution "erected on this side of the
Atlantic in which a chain was never used for the confinement
of a patient."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The hospital is still in a flourishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
condition and has accommodations for over two
hundred patients.</p>

<p>Massachusetts at the beginning of the nineteenth century
had no hospitals of any kind. In 1764, on the death
of Thomas Handcock, it was found that provision had
been made in his will for the establishment of a hospital
for mental diseases in Boston. An expenditure of six
hundred pounds was authorized for the purpose of
"erecting and furnishing a convenient House for the
reception and more comfortable keeping of such unhappy
persons as it shall please God, in His Providence,
to deprive of their reason in any part of this Province."
<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The Selectmen of Boston declined this legacy
on the grounds that there were not enough mental
cases in the vicinity to warrant the existence of
such an establishment. This proved to be an error
of judgment on their part. In 1811 the Massachusetts
General Hospital was incorporated and a fund
of over $93,000 was subscribed for building purposes.
As it was deemed more urgent, the department for mental
diseases in Charlestown was opened first. It was
ready for the reception of patients on October 6, 1818,
when it admitted a young man supposed to be possessed
of a devil. This department became the McLean Asylum
in 1826 as the result of a legacy of $25,000 left to the
institution by a Boston merchant of that name. The
corporation finally received in all an amount approximating
$120,000 from the McLean estate. As early as
1822 the first published report of the hospital<a name="FNanchor_15_15"
id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> called
attention to the fact that the various amusements offered
the patients included "draughts, chess, backgammon,
ninepins, swinging, sawing wood, gardening, reading,
writing, music, etc." A carriage and pair of horses for
the use of patients was purchased in 1828. In 1835 the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
first pianos and billiard tables were installed and a
library of one hundred and twenty volumes placed in the
wards. Hot water heating was introduced in 1848. It
is interesting to note that in 1827 the visiting committee
reported that the rates for the maintenance of patients
should not be less than three dollars or more than twelve
dollars per week. In 1882 the McLean Hospital established
the first training school for nurses connected with
any institution for mental diseases in this country. The
first class was graduated in 1886. In 1895 the hospital
was removed to Waverley, Massachusetts. A chemical
laboratory was opened in 1900 and a psychological laboratory
in 1904. Hydrotherapy was first used in 1899,
and a gymnasium was built in 1904. In 1913 the hospital
owned three hundred and seventeen acres of land and
had a capacity of two hundred and twenty beds, with a
plant valued at nearly two million dollars.</p>

<p>The first provision for the care of mental diseases in
Connecticut was a direct result of the activities of the
State Medical Society. It was on their petition that the
Hartford Retreat was chartered in 1822. Over two
thousand persons subscribed to a fund for the opening
of the hospital. These subscriptions included "$30 payable
in medicine," "One gross New London bilious pills,
price $30" and two lottery tickets.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16">
</a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> About fourteen
thousand dollars was subscribed in all, the citizens of
Hartford contributing four thousand. The hospital
building, designed to accommodate forty patients, was
opened on April 1, 1824, and has always been conducted
on an unusually high plane. It now averages about one
hundred and seventy-five patients.</p>

<p>Mental cases were first provided with hospital care
in Kentucky when the Eastern State Hospital was opened
in Lexington on May 1, 1824. Governor Adams, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
suggested the establishment of this institution, in a message
written in 1821 expressed the opinion that it would
be of great benefit to the students of Transylvania University,
"which would in time repay the obligation by
useful discoveries in the treatment of mental maladies."</p>

<p>The State Hospital at Columbia, South Carolina, was
opened in December, 1828. A curious fact in connection
with its history is that in 1829 the management, having
received no patients as yet, advertised for them in the
newspapers of South Carolina and adjoining states.</p>

<p>In 1829 the necessity of making further provision for
mental diseases in Massachusetts became the subject of
a legislative investigation and a committee was appointed
"to examine and ascertain the practicability and
expediency of erecting or procuring, at the expense of
the Commonwealth, an asylum for the safe keeping of
lunatics and persons furiously mad."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The report
of this committee, of which Horace Mann was Chairman,
is exceedingly interesting. The following is an
<span class="no-break">illustration:&mdash;</span>"To him whose mind is alienated, a prison is a
tomb, and within its walls he must suffer as one who
awakes to life in the solitude of the grave. Existence
and the capacity for pain alone are left him. From every
former source of pleasure or contentment he is violently
sequestered. Every former habit is abruptly broken off.
No medical skill seconds the efforts of nature for his
recovery, or breaks the strength of pain when it seizes
him with convulsive grasp. No friends relieve each other
in solacing the weariness of protracted disease. No
assiduous affection guards the avenues of approaching
disquietude. He is alike removed from all the occupations
of health, and from all the attentions everywhere
but within his homeless abode bestowed upon sickness.
The solitary cell, the noisome atmosphere, the unmitigated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
cold and the untempered heat, are of themselves
sufficient soon to derange every vital function of the body,
and this only aggravates the derangement of his mind.
On every side is raised up an insurmountable barrier
against his recovery. Cut off from all the charities of
life, endued with quickened sensibilities to pain, and
perpetually stung by annoyances which, though individually
small, rise by constant accumulation to agonies
almost beyond the power of mortal sufferance; if his
exiled mind in its devious wanderings ever approach the
light by which it was once cheered and directed, it sees
everything unwelcoming, everything repulsive and hostile,
and is driven away into returnless banishment."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18">
</a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The investigation conducted by this committee led to
the establishment of the Worcester Lunatic Hospital,
later the Worcester State Hospital, opened on January
19, 1833. The original building was designed to care for
one hundred and twenty patients. After many years of
agitation on the part of the public, the hospital was
removed to a site overlooking Lake Quinsigamond in the
outskirts of Worcester in 1877. It was soon found that
it was impracticable to dispense with the use of the old
building on Summer Street and it became the Worcester
Insane Asylum, later the Worcester State Asylum, and
finally the Grafton State Hospital. In 1919 it again
became a part of the Worcester State Hospital. The
original building is in excellent condition today and
promises an indefinite continuation of an unusual career
of usefulness. Many men destined to occupy positions of
importance in the psychiatric world were trained within
its walls.</p>

<p>The death of a prominent politician in 1806 is said
to have led indirectly to the establishment of the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
hospital for mental diseases in Vermont.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19">
</a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> His medical
advisers treated him for some form of mental alienation
by submerging him in water until he became unconscious.
It was thought that this "would divert his
mind and, by breaking the chain of unhappy associations,
thus remove the cause of his disease." As this plan
failed he was given opium as "the proper agent for the
stupefaction of the life forces." In spite of this vigorous
treatment he died. The immediate event which
made possible the incorporation of the Vermont Asylum
for the Insane in 1835 was a legacy of ten thousand dollars
rendered available for this purpose by the will of
Mrs. Anna Marsh of Hinsdale. The hospital was
opened in Brattleboro in 1836 and became the Brattleboro
Retreat after the establishment of the State Hospital
at Waterbury. The state care of mental diseases
began in Ohio with the establishment of the Columbus
State Hospital, which was opened on November 30, 1838.
This was the first of a number of institutions now under
the supervision of the Ohio Board of Administration.</p>

<p>The study of the development of the state hospital
system of care now takes us back to Massachusetts. Notwithstanding
the fact that the state already had two
institutions for mental cases, McLean and the Worcester
Lunatic Hospital, further accommodations were urgently
indicated. This was largely on account of the needs of
the metropolitan population centering in the city of Boston.
To meet this situation the city established a hospital
of its own in South Boston in 1839,&mdash;the first
municipal institution for this exclusive purpose in America.
Originally known as the Boston Lunatic Hospital
and afterwards as the Boston Insane Hospital, it finally
became the Boston State Hospital in December, 1908.
Charles Dickens on the occasion of his visit to America
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was very profoundly impressed by the hospital and made
the following references to it in <span class="no-break">1842<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>:&mdash;</span>"At South
Boston, as it is called, in a situation excellently adapted
for the purpose, several charitable institutions are clustered
together. One of these is the hospital for the
insane; admirably conducted on those enlightened principles
of conciliation and kindness which 20 years ago
would have been worse than heretical, and which have
been acted upon with so much success in our own pauper
asylum at Hanwell...." "At every meal, moral influence
alone restrains the more violent among them from
cutting the throats of the rest; but the effect of that
influence is reduced to an absolute certainty, and is found,
even as a measure of restraint, to say nothing of it as a
means of cure, a hundred times more efficacious than all
the straight waistcoats, fetters and handcuffs that ignorance,
prejudice and cruelty have manufactured since the
creation of the world." ... "In the labor department
every patient is as freely trusted with the tools of his
trade as if he were a sane man. In the garden and on the
farm they work with spades, rakes and hoes. For amusement
they walk, run, fish, paint, read, and ride out to take
the air in carriages provided for the purpose. They have
among themselves a sewing society to make clothes for
the poor, which holds meetings, passes resolutions, never
comes to fisticuffs or bowie-knives as sane assemblies
have been known to do elsewhere; and conducts all its
proceedings with the greatest decorum. The irritability
which would otherwise be expended on their own flesh,
clothes and furniture is dissipated in these pursuits.
They are cheerful, tranquil and healthy." ... "It is
obvious that one great feature of this system is the
inculcation and encouragement, even among such unhappy
persons, of a decent self-respect." The institution
was removed to the Dorchester district of Boston in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
1895, where it now houses in the neighborhood of two
thousand patients. The Boston State Hospital was the
first institution of its kind in the United States to establish
a separate psychopathic department, which was
opened in 1912.</p>

<p>Influenced doubtless by the attention given to this
subject in other states, Maine opened its first state hospital
at Augusta in 1840. There were between two and
three hundred mental cases in the state at that time. A
second hospital was opened at Bangor in 1889. This
humanitarian movement naturally extended to New
Hampshire. Governor Dinsmore in 1832<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> called attention
to the condition of the insane, seventy-six of whom
were in confinement. Of this number seven were in cells
or cages, six in chains and irons and four in jail. Of
those not in confinement at the time, some had been handcuffed
previously, while others had been in cells or
chained. After much unavoidable delay the New Hampshire
State Hospital was opened at Concord on October
29, 1842. The next hospital development appeared in
Georgia. After an active campaign inaugurated by the
physicians of the state and continued for several years,
the Georgia State Sanitarium was opened in Milledgeville
in December, 1842. It now houses over four thousand
patients.</p>

<p>By this time it became evident that further procedures
on behalf of the persons requiring treatment for
mental diseases in New York were imperative. The
Bloomingdale Hospital, although taxed to its utmost
capacity, was not able to meet the needs of the situation.
In 1830 the population of the state had increased to
nearly two million. The report of a legislative committee
showed that there were 2,695 insane persons in the state
in 1830, with hospital accommodations at Bloomingdale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and one other private hospital at Hudson for only two
hundred and fifty of these cases. An extensive system of
state care was inaugurated by the opening of the Utica
State Hospital on January 16, 1843. In addition to
numerous other industries and occupations, a printing
office was established in the hospital and the publication
of the "American Journal of Insanity" was undertaken
in 1844. This was the first journal in the world to be devoted
exclusively to the subject of mental diseases.
"The Opal," edited, published and printed by the patients
of the hospital, was started at the same time. In
the early days, strong rooms, padded cells and mechanical
restraint of all kinds were used extensively. The
"Utica Crib" has received a great deal of attention.
This consisted of an ordinary ward bed enclosed in
wooden slats, making it impossible for the patient to
escape. These were eliminated for all time by Dr. G.
Alder Blumer in 1887. Attendants were first required to
wear uniforms in 1887. During the following year
female nurses were assigned for the first time to male
wards. Annual field day exercises for the benefit of the
patients have been held since 1887. Baseball games,
steamboat excursions, Fourth of July celebrations and
Christmas entertainments have been in vogue since 1888.
With the development of a large department on the
"Marcy" site, nine miles from the city, the Utica State
Hospital promises to add new accomplishments to an
already dignified history.</p>

<p>The early care of mental cases in Rhode Island, as
shown by a report to the legislature by Thomas R.
Hazard in 1851, was perhaps no worse than that of other
states, although the conditions he described so graphically
have not been attributed to other New England
communities by historians. The following extract from
a codicil to the will of Nicholas Brown, who died in 1843,
is proof of the fact that this unfortunate state of affairs<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
had not entirely escaped notice<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>:&mdash;"And whereas it has
long been deeply impressed on my mind that an insane
or lunatic hospital or retreat for the insane should be
established upon a firm and permanent basis, under an
act of the Legislature, where that unhappy portion of
our fellow beings who are, by the visitation of Providence,
deprived of their reason, may find a safe retreat
and be provided with whatever may be most conducive
to their comfort and to their restoration to a sound state
of mind: Therefore, for the purpose of aiding an object
so desirable and in the hope that such an establishment
may soon be commenced, I do hereby set apart and give
and bequeath the sum of $30,000 towards the erection or
endowment of an insane or lunatic hospital or retreat for
the insane, or by whatever other name it may be called,
to be located in Providence or its vicinity." Supplemental
contributions by Cyrus Butler made it possible
for the incorporators to found the Butler Hospital in
Providence. The first patients were received on December
1, 1847.</p>

<p>More than any other one person, Miss Dorothea L. Dix
of Massachusetts was undoubtedly directly responsible
for the inauguration of the state care of mental diseases
in this country. She is credited with having memorialized
twenty-two different state legislatures on this subject.
One of her first accomplishments consisted in inducing
the New Jersey legislature to make an appropriation
for the establishment of the state hospital at
Trenton. This institution was opened in 1848, after some
of the hardest campaigning that Miss Dix conducted.
The last years of her life were spent as an honored guest
of the hospital and she died there in 1887 at the advanced
age of eighty-five.</p>

<p>Indiana inaugurated a system of state care by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
establishment of the Central Hospital for the Insane in
1848. The East Louisiana Hospital at Jackson was
opened in the same year. Missouri made its first provision
for mental cases by opening a hospital at Fulton
in 1852. Notwithstanding the fact that the first hospitals
for mental diseases in this country were located in
Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did
not make any provision for a state institution until the
State Hospital at Harrisburg was opened in 1851. This
was only undertaken after a vigorous campaign on the
part of Dorothea Dix had made some legislative action
almost imperative. This is probably the only hospital in
the country which has found it necessary to demolish all
of the original buildings and replace them by others. In
1847 Miss Dix visited Tennessee and started a movement
which resulted in the opening of The Central Hospital
for the Insane at Nashville, the first institution of the
kind in the state. California entered the state hospital
field in 1853 with the establishment of an institution at
Stockton. The St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington,
D.C., the first federal institution for mental diseases,
was opened for patients in 1855. It receives cases from
the United States Government Services and from the
District of Columbia. Dorothea Dix was largely instrumental
in its origin. The St. Elizabeths Hospital was an
early invader of the field of scientific research. A pathologist
was appointed in 1883. It was one of the first
institutions to use hydrotherapy extensively. It now
cares for nearly four thousand patients. Mississippi
established its first state hospital for mental diseases
in 1856, North Carolina in 1856, West Virginia in 1859,
Michigan in 1859, Wisconsin in 1860, Texas in 1861,
Kansas in 1866, Minnesota in 1866, Connecticut in 1868,
Rhode Island in 1870 and Vermont in 1891. The Sheppard
and Enoch Pratt Hospital, a well known private
institution in Baltimore, was also opened in 1891.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly worth while at this time to emphasize
the fact that the necessity of providing adequate facilities
for the care and treatment of mental diseases, a
problem which received little consideration of any kind
for many years, gradually led to the elaboration of an
extensive system of state hospitals. These are to be
found now in every part of the country. They have long
since passed through the purely custodial stage and have
developed into highly specialized modern hospitals of
most advanced type. Their function is to provide proper
treatment for persons who cannot for financial or other
reasons be cared for in the private hospitals which are
to be found in almost all localities. These institutions,
originating in Virginia in 1773, now represent one of the
most important activities conducted by any state government.
The extent of the field which they cover is
illustrated by the fact that Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Washington,
West Virginia and Wisconsin each maintain three
state hospitals for mental diseases; Iowa, Maryland,
Missouri and Virginia each have four institutions of this
type, Minnesota five, California, Indiana and Michigan
six, Pennsylvania seven, Ohio and Illinois nine, Massachusetts
twelve and New York fifteen. In addition to
this eight other states have two hospitals each and seventeen
find one such institution sufficient for their needs.
It is worthy of note that every state without any exception
has now recognized the necessity of making provision
for the care and treatment of mental diseases.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<span class="st">LEGISLATION AND METHODS OF
ADMINISTRATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p2">The administration of the earlier hospitals for mental
diseases was placed very wisely in the hands of local
boards of directors, managers or trustees. These were
made up of persons prominent in the community in
which they lived, well known as having a keen interest in
humanitarian movements, and fully deserving of the
confidence reposed in them by the public. They received
no compensation other than the satisfaction of
having served in a worthy cause. The state hospital at
Williamsburg, Virginia, the first of its kind in America,
was controlled by a court of directors which was made up
of some of the most prominent Virginians of colonial
days. It included Thomas Nelson, Jr., a signer of the
Declaration of Independence who served with distinction
in the Revolutionary War, Peyton Randolph, the
President of the first Continental Congress, and George
Wythe, the preceptor in law of both Marshall and Jefferson,
as well as a signer of the Declaration of Independence
and professor of law at William and Mary
College, together with various other distinguished citizens,
some perhaps of less prominence, but all men of the
highest standing in Virginia. The first "court" consisted
of fifteen members. The second state institution,
the Maryland Hospital, under the management of the city
of Baltimore for some years, was eventually placed
under the control of a board of visitors in 1828. Kentucky's
first hospital was from the beginning in the
charge of a board of ten commissioners. When the second<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Virginia institution was opened at Staunton, the
form of organization adopted at Williamsburg was duplicated
and a court of directors appointed. There were,
however, thirteen instead of fifteen members. The state
hospital at Columbia, South Carolina, was originally, and
still is, under a board of regents. The Massachusetts
hospitals, dating from the opening of Worcester in 1833,
have always had trustees. The Vermont Asylum, later
the Brattleboro Retreat, was also managed by a board
of trustees, as was the New Hampshire State Hospital
at Concord. The Georgia State Sanitarium, opened in
the same year, adopted a similar form of control. The
Utica State Hospital has been conducted from the first
by a board of managers, a term which is generally used
by the New York institutions. When the Trenton State
Hospital was founded it was placed under a board of
ten managers, more or less along the lines followed at
Utica. The State Hospital at Raleigh, North Carolina,
had a board of directors. For many years the earlier
institutions for mental diseases were under no other form
of control, the powers of the trustees being absolute.
This is still the case in a few states. Usually, however,
there is some additional form of supervision.</p>

<p>Boards of trustees, managers, directors, or some other
local governing body, exist in the following states but
without exclusive control:&mdash;Alabama, California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana
(administrators), Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina (regents), Texas and Virginia.
<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the following states the hospitals have no local
boards of any <span class="no-break">kind:&mdash;</span>Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah,
Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and
Wyoming.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>As the state hospitals increased in number and importance,
steps were taken to coordinate their activities
and for various obvious reasons they were soon grouped
together in departments. In the states having a sufficient
number of hospitals to warrant such a procedure,
separate specialized administrative units were established
under lunacy commissions, etc. In less populous
communities where there were only a few hospitals there
soon developed a tendency to associate them with the
charitable, correctional and, in some instances, penal institutions.
Seventeen states, as has been shown, now
have only one hospital for mental diseases, eight have
two and ten only three institutions. This led either to
placing the hospitals under boards of charities and corrections
or to the organization of new departments
known as boards of control. The hospitals for mental
diseases are under the supervision of boards of charities
and corrections in the following states:&mdash;Colorado,
Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North
Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota and Virginia.
<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Boards of control exist in Arkansas, California, Iowa,
Kentucky, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont,
West Virginia and Wisconsin. California has, in addition
to this, a board of charities and corrections and a
commission in lunacy. Vermont has a director of state
institutions. In New Hampshire the board of trustees
of the state hospital constitutes a commission in lunacy.
A number of states have special departments for the
supervision of hospitals for mental diseases and in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
instances for the control of all institutions. Delaware
has a board of supervisors of state institutions. This
is essentially a board of control. This is true of the
board of commissioners of state institutions in Florida.
Illinois has a department of public welfare, which places
the control of the charitable, penal and corrective institutions,
as well as the hospitals for mental diseases,
largely in the hands of one man, a layman. Michigan and
Pennsylvania also have departments of public welfare.
Kansas has placed its hospitals under the control of a
board of administration of state charitable institutions.
Maryland has a lunacy commission and Missouri a board
of managers. Montana and Nevada each have a board
of commissioners for the insane. New Jersey has a state
board of control of institutions and agencies, the direction
of the state hospitals being delegated to a commissioner
of charities and corrections. New York has the
largest department in the country having exclusive state
hospital functions. It is under the supervision of a hospital
commission. Ohio has a board of administration
which manages and governs all of the charitable, corrective
and penal institutions of the state. This is, of
course, a board of control pure and simple. Oklahoma
has a commissioner of charities and corrections who is an
elective officer, and has, in addition, a lunacy commission
and a board of public affairs. Rhode Island has a penal
and charitable commission of nine members. Utah has a
board of insanity and Wyoming a board of charities and
reform. Massachusetts has a department of mental diseases
under the direction of a medical commissioner,
with four unpaid associates. In addition to the hospitals
for mental diseases the department has under its
jurisdiction the institutions for the feebleminded and
the epileptics.</p>

<p>The necessity of some form of central supervision
or control, of state institutions in general and hospitals<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
for mental diseases in particular, has long been a subject
of serious consideration and discussion. The administration
of hospitals, prisons, reformatories, etc.,
by a central board of control may be indicated in states
where there are only a few institutions and the creation
of highly specialized and expensive departments obviously
would not be warranted. The question may very
properly be raised as to the necessity of any supervision
other than that by local boards of trustees in such communities.
A study of methods of supervision made some
years ago by the medical director of the National Committee
for Mental Hygiene<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> shows that the board of control
system leaves much to be desired. He has expressed
himself on this subject in no uncertain terms, as is shown
by the following:&mdash;"Under Boards of Control, politics
influence the care of the sick to a degree unknown under
different types of supervision and the scientific and humane
aspects of the work undertaken are generally subordinated
to doubtful administrative advantages. With
hardly an exception, these Boards of Control have not
endeavored to secure better commitment laws, to lead
public sentiment so that higher standards of treatment
will be demanded or to deal with the great problems of
mental disease in any except their narrowest institutional
aspects. There has been striking absence of evidences
of any feeling of personal responsibility in these matters;
indeed many members of these boards would doubtless
unhesitatingly state that their duties do not involve
such considerations. What the results would have been
if efficient and fearless local boards of managers had been
retained when these states created Boards of Control
cannot be stated. It is an essential part of the policy
which places the care of the insane under this form of
administration that there shall be no "division of responsibility"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and, seemingly, there is no place in such
a scheme for bodies which are as much interested in the
personal welfare of the wards of the State as they are in
governmental "efficiency" and, which, moreover, are directly
accountable to their neighbors&mdash;the friends and
relatives of patients. It is interesting to compare some
of the conditions mentioned with those existing in States
in which the care of the insane is entrusted to Boards
created for that special purpose. In these States,&mdash;California,
Maryland, Massachusetts and New York,&mdash;it can
be said truly that the care of the insane reaches its highest
level."</p>

<p>The experience of the past has shown that the injection
of politics into the administration of state institutions
is almost invariably due to the over-centralization
of power in state departments, the local boards of trustees
or managers either being abolished or largely deprived
of their authority. The greatest menace to the future
welfare of the hospitals for mental diseases is, in
the opinion of many, the unfortunate result of a popular
and more or less legitimate demand for the reorganization
of state governments, reducing their administrative
activities to a few separate departments, each one under
the entire charge of a director responsible only to the
Governor. The argument for this procedure is that it
does away with innumerable commissions, boards and
departments working along independent lines without
any reference to the desirability of coordinating the activities
of the state as a whole and places the affairs of
the commonwealth on an efficient, systematic and economical
basis. There is no question as to the theoretical
advisability of such methods. The difficulty is, that in
putting into practical operation this unquestionably commendable
undertaking, the humanitarian aspect of the
charitable enterprises conducted by state governments
for more than a century, is likely to be lost sight of. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is almost invariably urged that the directors of these
various departments should be experienced business men
of recognized ability and that in only such a way can the
affairs of the state be put on a "businesslike basis." It
must be confessed that this argument is one which appeals
very strongly to the taxpayer, who naturally has
not given the matter very careful thought. There are
other important considerations, however, where the question
of administering hospitals is involved. As Commissioner
Kline<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> has said:&mdash;"If it be conceded that the
care and treatment of the mentally sick is a highly specialized
medical problem, requiring the services of medical experts,
and that the institutions function primarily for the
welfare of the patient, then the supervision and control
of institutions should be in the hands of medical men
especially trained for the purpose."</p>

<p>In some instances where the state governments have
been reorganized and the proposed consolidation of departments
effected, the administration of the state hospitals
has come under the direction of a single individual
without hospital or institution experience of any kind
and without any special knowledge of medicine or psychiatry.
There is no escaping the fact that the administration
of a hospital is a medical problem. Nor is there
any question as to the advisability of some central supervision
and financial control of institutions. The hospital
departments in our more populous states are, however,
so extensive and so important that they cannot be merged
with other interests without sacrificing to a considerable
extent the welfare of the patients. It should be remembered,
moreover, that the administration of hospitals for
mental diseases is a specialty and a large one, not specifically
related to the problems arising in the management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of charitable institutions or prisons. The best results
have been obtained where there is a division of responsibility
between local boards of trustees or managers and
a central body charged with the supervision, and a limited
or complete financial control, of institutions for mental
diseases only. The head of such a department should
unquestionably be a medical man with psychiatric hospital
experience. This policy has been responsible for the
high standards maintained in the state hospitals of Massachusetts
and New York.</p>

<p>It is, unfortunately, true that the care of mental diseases
is not exclusively a function of the state or private
hospitals. In thirteen states, county or municipal institutions
are maintained and in twenty-five, persons
suffering from mental diseases may legally be cared for
in almshouses or poorhouses.</p>

<p>There is little uniformity in the laws of the various
states relative to the hospital care of mental diseases,
aside from the fact that almost without any exception
they are designed to provide solely for the legal custody
of the so-called "insane" and the protection of the public.
"Insanity," as a matter of fact, is a purely legal and
not a medical term, and may be said to relate to mental
diseases only in so far as they come within the jurisdiction
of the courts.</p>

<p>Statutory enactments relative to the forms of mental
disease which render the individual subject to legal custody
and detention in an institution are illustrated by the
provisions of the Civil Code of Illinois. This defines an
"insane" person as one "who by reason of unsoundness
of mind is incapable of managing his own estate, or is
dangerous to himself or others, if permitted to go at
large, or in such condition of mind or body as to be a fit
subject for care and treatment in a hospital or asylum for
the insane." In Alabama a person is legally insane "if
he has been found by a proper court deficient or defective<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mentally so that for his own or others' welfare his removal
is required for restraint, care, and treatment."
As a general rule, provision by law is made 1, for an
application for commitment; 2, for a medical certificate
of two or more properly qualified physicians showing the
person to be insane and a proper subject for care and
treatment in an institution, and 3, for the order of the
Judge of a Court of Record for commitment to a state
hospital. The necessity of some form of legal authorization
for detention is a result of the fundamental principle
in English procedure that no man, against his will, may
be deprived of his liberty without due process of law.
This right was recognized and perpetuated by the Magna
Charta signed by King John in 1215 and is very definitely
referred to in at least two different articles in the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p>As a rule the application for commitment can be made
only by certain persons definitely specified in the law,&mdash;parents,
near relatives, the guardian or various public
officials such as overseers of the poor. In Massachusetts
any person may sign such a petition. In Florida a request
must be jointly made by five reputable citizens.
This would not appear to be a material point in law.
Some courts require that a notice of the application be
served upon the person whose commitment is requested.
In New York a notice must be served at least one day
prior to the hearing of the case unless the judge personally
certifies that substituted service has been made upon
some other person or that personal service was considered
inadvisable for some adequate reason noted and has
therefore been dispensed with. The Arizona law requires
the judge to hold a hearing and have the alleged insane
person before him for examination. In California a jury
trial may be requested and a commitment made only on
a verdict of insanity requiring a vote of at least three-fourths
of the jurors. A trial by jury may be asked for<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in Colorado, Connecticut and many other states and must
be granted. Trial by jury is necessary in all cases in
Georgia. Provision is usually made for an appeal to
some higher court. In many states hearings are mandatory,
in others they are optional with the court. In
Iowa each county has a board of three commissioners of
insanity, one of whom must be a physician. They have
full authority under the law to make commitments to
institutions. Hearings are required in Kansas but inquests
in lunacy may be either by jury or commission at
the discretion of the court. In Kentucky inquests in
lunacy must be held by the Circuit Court of a county.
The hearings are always in the presence of a jury. In
Louisiana two physicians must examine the patient in the
presence of the court. If the physicians do not agree
the judge himself decides the case. In Maine parents
and guardians may send insane minors to an institution
without a commitment. Other insane persons are subject
to examination by the municipal officers of towns. In
Mississippi the Chancery Courts have jurisdiction over
writs of lunacy and an inquest may be made by jury. Nebraska
has three commissioners in insanity in each
county, appointed by the judge of the District Court. In
the case of persons found insane they issue a warrant
authorizing admission to a state hospital. Each county
in New Jersey has a commissioner in lunacy, who has
jurisdiction over the steps relating to admission to institutions.
Commitments are made by the judge of a Court
of Record. All orders for commitments in North Carolina
must be made by the clerk of a Superior Court. No
person who has moved into the state while insane is
deemed a resident. North Dakota has a board of three
commissioners of insanity in each county, the county
judge being a member. The commissioners authorize
hospitals to receive persons found to be insane. Appeal
may be made to a commission of three persons to be appointed<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
by the county judge. A jury trial is provided
for, on demand, in Oklahoma. In cases of appeal the
county judge must appoint a commission of three,
one of whom is a physician, for the examination of
the patient. Examination by a commission of three
is required in Pennsylvania before commitment by
a justice of a Court of Common Pleas or Quarter
Sessions. South Dakota has a board of three commissioners
of insanity in each county, the county judge being
a member. An insane person may be received in a hospital
in Vermont on the certificate of two physicians
or by the order of a County or Supreme Court without
a physician's certificate. Appeal may be made to the
state board of control. In Virginia the committing judge
and two physicians constitute a commission for the examination
of alleged insane persons. In West Virginia
there is a county commission of lunacy composed of the
president and clerk of the County Court and the prosecuting
attorney. Commitments are ordered by the commission.
On the arrival of the patient at a hospital a
board composed of the Superintendent and assistant
physicians must be convened for the examination of the
patient. Application for commitment must be made in
Wisconsin by three reputable citizens. The determination
of insanity in Wyoming must be made in all instances
by a jury of six men.</p>

<p>When an insane person has been committed to an institution
it is sometimes the duty of an officer of the court
to accompany the patient to the hospital. The order of
the court in Massachusetts includes the following:&mdash;"Now,
Therefore, You, the said Sheriff, Deputies, Constables
or Police Officers, and each of you, with necessary
assistance, ... are hereby commanded, in the name
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, forthwith to
convey the said &mdash;&mdash; to the hospital aforesaid, and
to deliver h&mdash; to the Superintendent thereof, and make<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
due return of a copy of this precept with your doings
therein." This practically amounts to a warrant of
arrest and makes the removal of the patient to the hospital
to all intents and purposes analogous to a criminal
proceeding.</p>

<p>Attention should be called to one of the very excellent
and humane provisions of the New York Law:&mdash;"All
county superintendents of the poor, overseers of the
poor, health officers and other city, town or county authorities,
having duties to perform relating to the poor,
are charged with the duty of seeing that all poor and indigent
insane persons within their respective municipalities,
are timely granted the necessary relief conferred
by this chapter. The poor officers or authorities
above specified, except in the city of New York and in
the county of Albany, shall notify the health officer of
the town, city or village of any poor or indigent insane
or apparently insane person within such municipality
whom they know to be in need of the relief conferred by
this chapter. When so notified, or when otherwise informed
of such fact, the health officer of the city, town or
village, except in the city of New York and the county
of Albany, where such insane or apparently insane person
may be, shall see that proceedings are taken for the
determination of his mental condition and for his commitment
to a state hospital. Such health officer may direct
the proper poor officer to make an application for such
commitment, and, if a qualified medical examiner, may
join in making the required certificate of lunacy. When
so directed by such health officer it shall be the duty of
the said poor officer to make such application for commitment.
When notified or informed of any poor or
indigent insane or apparently insane person in need
of the relief conferred by this chapter such health officer
shall provide for the proper care, treatment and nursing
of such person, as provided by law and the rules of the<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
commission, pending the determination of his mental condition
and his commitment and until the delivery of such
insane person to the attendant sent to bring him to the
state hospital, as provided in this chapter."</p>

<p>In New York City these responsibilities are delegated
to the trustees of Bellevue and Allied Hospitals and in
the county of Albany to the Commissioner of Public
Charities. In New York City a medical examiner or
nurse from the psychopathic wards of Bellevue Hospital,
or both, may be sent "to the place where the alleged insane
person resides or is to be found." If in the opinion
of this examiner medical care is necessary, the patient
is taken to the psychopathic ward for observation for
a period of not to exceed ten days. When a person has
been committed to a state hospital in New York, the
Superintendent is required by law to send a trained nurse
or attendant to bring the patient to the institution. The
desirability of having such cases under the immediate
care of nurses who have had psychiatric training would
seem to be obvious. There is no reason why persons
suffering from mental diseases should be subjected to
the same form of supervision that is given to criminals.
The New York plan of holding the health officer responsible
for providing proper hospital care and treatment
for mental cases not coming directly under the legal jurisdiction
of other persons or officials is well worthy of
serious consideration. There would appear to be no
reason why the health officer should not be responsible
for mental conditions in somewhat the same way that
he is for communicable diseases. Nor is there any public
official to whom the supervision of the insane pending
commitment can more logically be delegated.</p>

<p>In twenty-nine states voluntary patients may be received
by state hospitals. The provisions of the law
usually are that the patient must make application on
his own initiative, that his mental condition must be<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
such as to understand the purpose of this proceeding
and the need of treatment and that he must be released
on a demand in writing in from three to seven days of
such request. In the twelve following states the temporary
care of the insane in jails, usually as an emergency
measure, is still authorized:&mdash;Arkansas, Colorado,
Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
South Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
Arrangements of some kind for the emergency
care of cases pending examination and commitment are
provided for in Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Washington and Wisconsin. Massachusetts has
the most comprehensive provisions for temporary care
and observation. The Superintendent of a state hospital
may receive and detain, for not more than five days without
a court order, any person whose case is "certified to
be one of violent and dangerous insanity or of other
emergency" by two qualified medical examiners. Officers
authorized to serve a criminal process, or police officers,
must, on the request of the applicant or one of the examining
physicians, bring such a person to the hospital.
The applicant for this form of admission must within
five days arrange for the commitment of the person so
received, or for his removal from the hospital.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Massachusetts Law a
person found by two qualified examiners to be in such
mental condition that his admission to a hospital for the
insane is necessary for his proper care or observation
may be committed for a period of thirty-five days "pending
the determination of his insanity." The superintendent
must discharge such a person within thirty days
if not insane or report to the committing judge his opinion
that the patient's mental condition is such as to require
a further residence in the hospital necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the provisions of the so-called "Boston Police
Act" (chapter 307 of the Acts of 1910) all persons suffering
from delirium, mania, mental confusion, delusions or
hallucinations, under arrest or "who come under the care
or protection of the police of the city of Boston" shall
be taken to the Psychopathic Hospital "in the same
manner in which persons afflicted with other diseases are
taken to a general hospital." Cases suffering from delirium
tremens or drunkenness may be refused by the
hospital authorities; otherwise, all such persons are admitted,
observed and cared for "until they can be committed
or admitted to the hospital or institution appropriate
in each particular case" unless the patient recovers
or is discharged.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Massachusetts Law "No
person suffering from insanity, mental derangement, delirium
or mental confusion, except delirium tremens and
drunkenness, shall, except in case of emergency, be placed
or detained in a lockup, police station, city prison, house
of detention, jail or other penal institution, or place for
the detention of criminals. If, in case of emergency,
any such person is so placed or detained, he shall forthwith
be examined by a physician and shall be furnished
suitable medical care and nursing and shall not be so detained
for more than twelve hours." In Boston these
cases are sent to the Psychopathic Hospital. In other
parts of the state they are cared for by the board of
health of the city or town in question until they can be
committed to a hospital or cared for by relatives or
friends.</p>

<p>The superintendent of a state hospital, under the
authority of chapter 123 of the General Laws, "When requested
by a physician, by a member of the board of
health or a police officer of a city or town, by an agent of
the institutions registration department of the city of
Boston, or by a member of the district police 'may' receive<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and care for in such hospital as a patient, for a
period not exceeding ten days, any person who needs immediate
care and treatment because of mental derangement
other than delirium tremens or drunkenness." Such
cases are received on application in writing filed at the
time of the reception of the patient or within twenty-four
hours thereafter and must be discharged or committed
within ten days unless they make a request for
voluntary care. During 1920 there were 1,929 temporary
care cases reported by the various Massachusetts state
hospitals, as follows:</p>

<p>Boston State Hospital (Psychopathic Department)
1,049, Danvers 217, Northampton 188, Worcester 159,
Taunton 154, Westborough 68, Foxborough 56, Medfield
33, Grafton 2, and Gardner State Colony 3.</p>

<p>Nowhere else in the country has this particular form
of legislation been used so extensively. It is something
more than a mere authorization for the reception of mental
cases in observation or detention wards. Under its
provisions, at the request of any reputable practicing
physician and without further legal formalities, mental
cases may be cared for in a state hospital until their condition
can be definitely determined and arrangements
made for their proper disposition and treatment. The
criticism to which this plan is open is that the period of
time, ten days, is not long enough. It should be extended
to thirty days at least.</p>

<p>The provision of the Massachusetts Law for the determination
of the mental condition of persons under arrest
or held under criminal charges is an excellent one
and well worthy of consideration. This is covered by
chapter 123 of the General Laws:&mdash;"If a person under
complaint or indictment for any crime, is, at the time
appointed for trial or sentence, or at any time prior
thereto, found by the Court to be insane or in such mental
condition that his commitment to a hospital for the insane<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is necessary for the proper care or observation of
such person pending the determination of his insanity,
the Court may commit him to a State hospital for the
insane under such limitations as it may order." The
Court may in its discretion employ one or more experts
to examine such persons. These cases are on recovery
returned by the hospital authorities to the custody of
the Court. One of the interesting features of the Massachusetts
Law is the provision relating to persons indicted
for murder or manslaughter but acquitted by a jury by
reason of insanity. Such cases are committed to a state
hospital for life and can be discharged only by the Governor
of the state, with the advice and consent of the
Executive Council, when he is satisfied, after an investigation
by the Department of Mental Diseases, that such
a person may be discharged "without danger to others."
Persons charged with a crime "other than murder or
manslaughter" and acquitted by a jury by reason of
insanity may also be committed by the Court to a state
hospital "under such limitations as it deems proper" and
such orders may be revoked at any time.</p>

<p>A recent enactment (Chapter 415, Acts of 1921) provides
that "Whenever a person is indicted by a grand
jury for a capital offense or whenever a person, who is
known to have been indicted for any other offense more
than once or to have been previously convicted of a
felony, is indicted by a grand jury or bound over for
trial in the superior court, the clerk of the court in which
the indictment is returned, or the clerk of the district
court or the trial justice, as the case may be, shall give
notice to the department of mental diseases, and the department
shall cause such person to be examined with a
view to determine his mental condition and the existence
of any mental disease or defect which would affect his
criminal responsibility. The department shall file a report
of its investigation with the clerk of the court in<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which the trial is to be held, and the report shall be accessible
to the court, the district attorney and to the
attorney for the accused, and shall be admissible as evidence
of the mental condition of the accused."</p>

<p>The whole question of methods of commitment was
made the subject of an extended study by the National
Committee for Mental Hygiene in 1919. A comprehensive
report covering such legislation as was deemed necessary
was submitted by a committee consisting of the
following:&mdash;Dr. George M. Kline, Commissioner, Massachusetts
State Department of Mental Diseases; Dr.
Charles W. Pilgrim, Chairman of the New York State
Hospital Commission; Dr. Owen Copp, Superintendent,
Pennsylvania Hospital, Department for Nervous and
Mental Diseases: Dr. Frank P. Norbury, of the Board
of Public Welfare Commissioners of Illinois; and Dr.
Frankwood E. Williams, Associate Medical Director, National
Committee for Mental Hygiene. In addition to the
ordinary form of commitment by a court of record in a
civil proceeding, they recommended legislation in all
states authorizing temporary and emergency care, observation
pending the determination of insanity, and
voluntary admissions. In a general way, the legislation
recommended followed the lines of the present laws
of Massachusetts and New York.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<span class="st">THE STATE HOSPITALS&mdash;THEIR ORGANIZATION
AND FUNCTIONS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p2">The efficiency of the hospital is very largely a reflection
of its organization, administration and personnel,
but the material equipment of the institution and the financial
resources available are factors of no less importance.
The future of a hospital is often settled for all
time by the degree of judgment exercised in determining
its location. The founders must be guided to a very great
extent by the purposes which they hope to accomplish.
In the location of a public institution of any considerable
size, however, there are certain considerations which, if
overlooked, will eventually lead to serious difficulties.
The initial cost of the property is unfortunately a factor
which cannot be disregarded. It is usually considered
desirable for obvious reasons to choose a site somewhat
removed from great centers of population. A sufficient
acreage must be obtained to guarantee an adequate
amount of land for farming and gardening on a fairly
large scale. This not only insures a ready occupation for
patients, but will materially reduce the cost of maintenance.
A point which should never be lost sight of
is the necessity of choosing a location which can be
reached easily by railroads, trolley cars and motor trucks.
The hospital must be readily accessible to the relatives
and friends of patients. It is equally important that it
should be convenient for employees; otherwise an adequate
force of nurses and attendants can only be maintained
with great difficulty. Above all, the hospital
should be in the community which it is destined to serve.<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
The patients should not be removed to any great distance
from their homes. In numerous instances severe
hardships have been inflicted upon all persons concerned
owing to the fact that state institutions have been located
in districts where they are not needed by the community
and where they cannot be easily reached.</p>

<p>Every large public hospital should be in almost immediate
contact with a railroad. Otherwise thousands of
dollars must be expended annually for the transportation
of coal, food and other necessary supplies. The
fertility of the soil to be used for agricultural purposes
is only second in importance to the necessity of obtaining
satisfactory building sites. A practically unlimited supply
of pure water is absolutely essential. The possibility
of utilizing some existing system of sewerage or providing
the institution with one of its own should be given
serious consideration. Drainage must be provided for
and sanitary surroundings obtained. There should always
be opportunity for future expansion of the plant.
Practically every state of any importance has at least
one institution which has been seriously handicapped
throughout its entire existence by an unfortunate neglect
of one or more of these important considerations.</p>

<p>In 1917 a special commission was appointed by the
Governor of New York for the purpose of preparing an
intelligent and comprehensive plan for the future development
of the institutions of the state. In a report
presented during the following year the commission
called attention to a phase of hospital construction the
importance of which cannot be too strongly emphasized.
<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
"Nearly all of the state hospitals suffer from the fact
that as originally planned they were smaller institutions
and of a different type from those that are now desired,
and the additions which have been made from time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
time during the past twenty-five years, in order to meet
the immediate demands for increased space, have not always
been made with a completed and well rounded institution
in mind. The results are badly balanced institutions,
lacking in efficiency and ease of administration....
In planning a hospital for the insane the ultimate
maximum capacity should be decided upon even if it is
not possible to build the entire institution at once. A
well co-ordinated plan should then be developed, which
would permit the building of various sections as appropriations
become available, with the idea of finally having
a complete institution, harmonious in arrangement,
and so planned as to attain the most desirable classification
and the maximum of efficiency and economy in administration."
The classification of the population which
an average state hospital should provide buildings for
is shown by the commission as follows:&mdash;Reception building,
six per cent; convalescents, four per cent; hospital
buildings, two per cent; buildings for the infirm, eight
per cent; noisy, disturbed, etc., twenty per cent; epileptics,
three per cent; working patients, forty per cent;
quiet, clean and appreciative chronic class, fourteen per
cent; and tuberculous, three per cent. They also suggest
that every hospital should have a small isolation building
for the care of contagious diseases. Their recommendation
as to the amount of floor space per patient in
the various buildings is exceedingly interesting and no
less important. "First, That single rooms should have
about eighty square feet of floor space. A room seven
feet by eleven or eight by ten, while large enough for one
bed, a bureau and a chair, is not large enough to permit
placing two beds end to end or alongside of each other.
If a room measures ten feet by twelve, there is always a
temptation to place two beds in it if the hospital becomes
crowded, and the advantage of single rooms is wholly
lost. The number of single rooms in an institution should<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be from fifteen per cent to twenty per cent of the population,
varying with the character of the cases to be cared
for. Second, Dormitories should have above fifty square
feet of floor space per patient, and no dormitory should
have more than fifty beds nor less than six. This, of
course, applies to the wards for the chronic cases. An
adequate system of ventilation throughout the hospital
is presupposed. Third, The day space allotted should
provide forty to fifty square feet per patient. Fourth,
The dining room allowance should be from fourteen to
sixteen square feet per patient, in order to permit the
use of small tables and to provide adequate passages
for the expeditious service of food."</p>

<p>In former years much time and space was devoted to
a discussion of the respective merits of the congregate
type of hospital construction, the so-called "Kirkbride"
or block plan (although it was in use long before Kirkbride
described it) and the arrangement of buildings in
groups. There is no question but what an institution
that is all under one roof can be administered much more
economically and operated at a lower maintenance cost.
Very little, if any, advantage is derived by the patient
from the group scheme. In its practical operation in
the state hospitals almost the only point of difference,
as far as the patient is concerned, is that he must go out
of doors as a rule to get to the dining room in the summer
as well as in the winter, in good weather and bad.
This has been responsible for much discomfort and has
resulted in a great increase in the number of escapes.
When buildings are arranged in groups they should be
connected with a central dining room either by corridors
or tunnels. Small cottages, except for special purposes,
are out of the question as far as state institutions are
concerned, on account of the cost involved. As a matter
of fact, in the development of a large hospital all types
of construction must be ultimately employed. The reception<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
building should be separate and detached from
the other parts of the hospital, as should, of course, the
wards for the tuberculous cases, the contagious building,
the building for convalescents, the farm cottages, etc.
The noisy and violent patients certainly should be in
separate buildings far enough away so that they will not
disturb others. The hospital wards, for the exclusive
care of bed patients, may well be detached. The larger
part of the hospital population, consisting of the quiet,
orderly, chronic, custodial cases, can be cared for just as
well in the large buildings as in groups or cottages.</p>

<p>The reception building, from the standpoint of the
patient, is the most important building in the hospital.
It should be equipped to care for from five to ten per
cent of the hospital population, depending entirely upon
the location and special problems of the institution in
question and the community which it serves. In any
event it should include both large and small dormitories,
the larger accommodating from fifteen to thirty patients,
and the smaller not more than six or eight, adequate day-room
space, numerous single rooms and commodious
enclosed verandas. There should, of course, be ample
dining room facilities as well as diet rooms to provide
for those whose condition makes it necessary or advisable
for them to be served in the wards. Special provision
should be made for the separate care of the noisy,
violent, disturbed, etc., and they should be in a part of the
building which can be isolated. The suicidal cases must
be given special care and separate supervision. A well
equipped hydrotherapeutic department is an essential
part of the reception building. Continuous bath and pack
rooms are equally necessary. No less important are admission
and examination rooms, a pharmacy, laboratories,
rooms for the special treatment of eye, ear, nose
and throat conditions, recreation rooms, a library, space
for occupational therapy, provision for social service and<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
psychological departments, etc. At least two physicians
should reside in the building. It is unfortunate that reception
buildings as a rule are entirely too small. They
should be large enough so that the acute and recoverable
cases, as well as those found on observation not to require
hospital treatment, can be returned to their homes without
any further contact with the hospital or the necessity
of a protracted residence with the chronic and purely
custodial cases.</p>

<p>The experience of many years has shown quite conclusively
that the supervision and general direction of a
hospital for mental diseases should be delegated to a
medical superintendent with such clinical and administrative
assistants as the nature and size of the institution
may indicate. The dual system of management frequently
suggested by politicians, with a layman as the
executive head and a medical director subordinated to his
authority, has proved to be a failure in every instance in
which it has been tried. The administrative details necessary
to the successful operation of a large institution are
such as to require the entire time and attention not only
of the superintendent but usually of an assistant superintendent.
In a large hospital the activities of the medical
staff should be under the immediate supervision of a
specialist whose training and experience qualify him to
direct the clinical and psychiatric work of others. This
is a quite sufficient task to require the constant attention
and undivided energies of a clinical director who has no
other interests or responsibilities. In this way recent
graduates with proper qualifications may be interested
in entering the psychiatric field. Every state hospital,
in addition to fulfilling its entire duty to the patients in
its charge, should be a training school for psychiatrists,
social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists
and psychiatric nurses. The hospital staff, as well as
providing for the services of physicians well trained in<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
psychiatry, must include other specialists. A hospital
of any size should have a staff of consulting and visiting
physicians including several internists and surgeons, a
gynecologist, a neurologist, a dermatologist, an ophthalmologist,
a laryngologist and an otologist. These consultants
should visit the hospital regularly and direct
and supervise the work of the resident staff along the
lines of their specialty. It is hardly necessary to suggest
today that a hospital of any size without a resident
dentist is one which is not properly equipped to care for
its patients.</p>

<p>Nothing is more important in the modern hospital
than the training school for nurses. It is the nursing
care of the patients more than any other one thing perhaps
that has made the difference between the old time
asylum and the psychiatric hospital of the highest type.
The state hospital training school of the present day
offers its pupils a three years' course of instruction, including
a year of practical experience in an affiliated general
hospital. Its graduates, moreover, are trained not
only in psychiatric and general nursing, as well as the
care of neurological cases, but in hydrotherapy, occupational
therapy, reeducational, industrial and social work.
The nurse of the future who has had no psychiatric training
and experience is one whose education is not complete.
Every effort should be made to encourage the
training schools of general hospitals to send their senior
nurses to a hospital for mental diseases for a service of
at least three months. The specialized care and treatment
of cases suffering from tuberculosis has been neglected
in many institutions. It should not be necessary
to suggest that such cases have no place in a ward with
other patients who have not contracted that disease, and
yet in many of our large and important hospitals there
are no separate buildings for that purpose. It has been
shown by statistical studies that persons suffering from<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
dementia praecox have an unusual and remarkable susceptibility
to tuberculosis. Unfortunately, it has never
been possible to completely segregate the epileptics in
our public hospitals for mental diseases. They constitute
a special problem and should receive a different diet
as well as an entirely different type of treatment. Their
presence in the wards with mental cases is highly detrimental
to both. This is equally true of drug cases and
mental defectives, and especially the so-called defective
delinquents.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why every hospital of any
consequence that is engaged in the care of mental diseases
should be provided with a well trained and experienced
pathologist. Examinations of urine and sputum
must be made daily. Widal tests are sometimes necessary
for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Analyses of
water and milk should be made at frequent intervals.
Bacteriological vaccines should be available at any time.
Only laboratory investigations can throw any light on
the source of the frequent infections which are found in
large institutions. Diphtheria is a disease which must
be guarded against constantly. Lumbar punctures, Wassermann
tests, the colloidal gold reaction, cell counts,
etc., are daily necessities in a large hospital. We lose
much information of value to us if autopsies are neglected.
A definite program of pathological research
work should be carried on in every hospital for mental
diseases. It has been suggested frequently that the
microscope has no part to play in studying the etiology
of the psychoses and that they are purely functional in
origin. Many of them are functional. It is nevertheless
equally true that we have a definite pathological basis
for the traumatic psychoses, the senile conditions, cerebral
arteriosclerosis, general paresis, brain syphilis, cerebral
growths, mental deficiency and many other brain and
nervous diseases. The psychosis most clearly understood<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
from the standpoint of etiology, pathology, symptomatology
and diagnosis is general paresis. Our definite
knowledge of that condition was obtained entirely
from the laboratory. Further information may be secured
in the same way. While it is true that we have
not had any great amount of success as yet with the
treatment of general paresis with salvarsan, the positive
knowledge that the disease is of syphilitic origin should
encourage us in our efforts to solve the problem of
curing it. Histological, pathological, bacteriological,
chemical, clinical and psychological researches must be
pushed vigorously if psychiatry is to keep pace with
the general progress shown by modern medicine in other
fields.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject some reference should
be made to the general neglect of statistical studies.
They should be based on detailed, accurate and exhaustive
clinical records, which unfortunately are not now
available to the extent that they should be. It is true
that in a general way some progress has been made. The
studies instituted by the American Psychiatric Association
will ultimately tell us quite definitely the frequency
of the various psychoses, the recovery and death rates
to be expected, etc. We should not be satisfied with that
alone. The great wealth of material which we have in
our hospitals, together with the excellent clinical and
laboratory facilities at our disposal, should enable us to
accomplish much more. An analysis of our case records,
if properly made, would give us definite information
as to the clinical aspects of the mental diseases we are
dealing with. These should be made the subject of exhaustive
study by the scientific institutes and other
research departments conducted by the various state
authorities to an extent never yet undertaken or even
attempted. If it cannot be done by the states it should
be instituted by the federal government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that the field of influence of our public institutions
should extend far beyond the walls of the hospital
is one which has received general recognition only
within the last few years. Every hospital has a large
number of patients still within its legal custody but who
have been allowed to return temporarily to their homes
or occupations while still under observation pending
their final discharge. These are now, to a very limited
extent, under the supervision of social workers. The
hospitals have unfortunately, owing to a lack of funds,
never had a sufficient number of social workers to look
after them properly. The hospitals as a rule now
maintain out-patient departments where those who
have been allowed to go home on visit or resume
their occupations are encouraged to come for assistance
and advice. The public is gradually learning
to take advantage of this opportunity to obtain
expert advice on matters relating to mental hygiene and
secure professional opinions as to the disposition and
treatment of members of the family showing symptoms
of incipient mental disorders. This field of influence extends
even further. Clinics have been established in
various locations outside of the hospitals in the larger
cities in several states. In New York they are conducted
by state hospital physicians in Binghamton, Brooklyn,
Buffalo, Plattsburg, Dunkirk, Jamestown, Olean, Salamanca,
Poughkeepsie, Peekskill, Yonkers, Mount Vernon,
Mineola, Newburgh, Kingston, Rochester, Middletown,
Ogdensburg, Malone, Watertown, Utica, Schenectady,
Ovid, Ithaca and New York City. Physicians and social
workers are in attendance at all of these places. The
last published report of the New York State Hospital
Commission (1919) shows that 7,203 visits were made to
these clinics during the year. Paroled patients made
5,102 of these, discharged patients 265 and others who
had no connection with the hospitals at all, 1,836. In<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
addition to this the hospital social workers made 3,496
visits to paroled patients as well as four hundred and
sixty-two visits to other patients for the purpose of preventing
mental diseases. Situations were obtained for
one hundred and sixty-seven discharged patients. An
enormous amount of work was also done in history taking,
etc. Numerous clinics have been established in
Massachusetts by the Department of Mental Diseases.
<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
During the year ending November 30, 1919, a total of
4,333 visits were reported. Of these 3,057 were first
visits. The number reported by the various hospitals
was as follows:&mdash;Worcester State Hospital 1,278, Taunton
State Hospital 182, Northampton State Hospital
458, Danvers State Hospital 282, Westborough State
Hospital 177, Grafton State Hospital 129, Gardner Colony
65, Monson State Hospital 70, Foxborough State
Hospital 27, Massachusetts School for the Feebleminded
541, Boston State Hospital (Psychopathic Department)
2,112. Clinics were maintained in the following localities:&mdash;Athol,
Boston, Brockton, Danvers, Fitchburg,
Foxborough, Gardner, Grafton, Gloucester, Greenfield,
Haverhill, Lawrence, Lynn, Malden, Medfield, Monson,
New Bedford, Newburyport, Northampton, Pittsfield,
Salem, Springfield, Taunton, Waverley, Westborough,
Worcester and Wrentham.</p>

<p>This is a gratifying evidence of progress. There are
indications of an awakening. The hospital treatment of
mental diseases will eventually be conducted on a much
higher plane and along lines more nearly comparable to
those of the general hospital. A study of legislation
relating to mental disease shows that efforts are being
made very generally to make their treatment a medical
problem rather than a legal question. It has been no
easy matter to obtain treatment for mental diseases, assuming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a desire on the part of the individual to take
advantage of such an opportunity. A review of our
legal enactments shows that as a general rule it means
a formal application, properly verified, an elaborate examination
by two qualified physicians, an order of commitment
by the judge of a court of record, a legal notice
and an opportunity for a hearing if one is demanded.
Pennsylvania as early as 1883 made provision for the
immediate admission of such cases as required it, pending
the usual court procedure. As has been shown in another
chapter, arrangements have been legalized in many
states for the emergency reception of mental cases, at
least for those persons who are known to be dangerous
to themselves or others. Temporary care enactments
have been written into the law in various communities,
making it possible to keep mental cases under observation
for a limited period of time. In a large number of
states it is now possible for a person requesting treatment
voluntarily to receive it on his own application
without any other legal formalities. Perhaps the greatest
advance is the custom, not so infrequent now, of sending
persons held by courts under a criminal process to a
hospital for observation as to their mental condition. The
fact should not be lost sight of that it is still possible to
find "insane" persons in jails, poorhouses and county
institutions in many parts of the country. Worse than
this, however, is the custom of delegating their care to
police officers. Nevertheless, distinct progress has been
made.</p>

<p class="p2b">As has already been shown, a study of methods of
care in this country indicates that every state has passed
through several very definite preliminary stages. These
may be summarized as follows:&mdash;</p>



<p class="p8b">1. &nbsp;A period of home care only. During the colonial days mental
cases were cared for at home or not at all. There was
nothing else that could be done for them at the time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="p8b">2. &nbsp;Confinement with criminals. In cases of unusual violence,
dangerous persons were confined in jails, lockups and prisons.
If necessary, under certain circumstances the law
in some states even authorized the use of chains.</p>

<p class="p8b">3. &nbsp;Almshouse care. There has been a time in practically every
state when the poorhouse has been looked upon as the proper
place for the insane.</p>

<p class="p8b">4. &nbsp;Asylum care. As a result of the agitation of Dorothea Dix
and others, mental diseases were eventually given custodial
care in asylums.</p>

<p class="p8b">5. &nbsp;Modern hospital care.</p>

<p class="p2">In 1894 Dr. S. Weir Mitchell<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> delivered the annual
address at the semi-centennial meeting of the American
Medico-Psychological Association in Philadelphia. It
was a very painful occasion for many. His remarks may
be summed up as a vigorous arraignment of the asylum
methods of that day. He severely criticized the public,
the state legislatures, boards of management and the hospital
superintendents. His principal charge was that
they were operating asylums along the lines of the past
and were perfectly satisfied with what they had accomplished.
He pointed out the necessity of properly qualified
physicians, more scientific methods and modern treatment.
"We have done with whip and chains and ill
usage, and having won this noble battle have we not
rested too easily content with having made the condition
of the insane more comfortable?" It seems incredible
that in the case records of that day he should have found
no evidences "of blood counts, temperatures, reflexes,
the eye-ground, color fields, all the minute examinations
with which we are so unrestingly busy." One institution
was unable to furnish Dr. Mitchell with a stethoscope
or an ophthalmoscope! One of his criticisms was that
few institutions for mental diseases had a training school
for nurses or any provisions for hydrotherapy. His last
words were almost a prophecy: "Fifty years hence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
when we must all have been swept away, another will
possibly stand in my place and tell your history, and to
him and the bountiful wisdom of time I leave it to be
declared whether I was right or wrong." Dr. Mitchell's
description of the asylums and their methods was bitterly
resented. Who is there today who would not feel
that he was fully justified?</p>

<p>The time has come when we must again look to the
future and prepare for it. The purely custodial care of
mental diseases has led to a dread of asylums on the
part of the public. There are unfortunately too many
hospitals that are asylums in everything but name. The
establishment of psychopathic hospitals and psychiatric
clinics and the way in which they have been welcomed by
the public is suggestive. The problems of mental diseases,
as far as possible, must be approached from a
general hospital point of view and the psychiatric hospital
of the future must have a modern equipment, an
efficient staff and adequate facilities for the employment
of the latest methods. Above all, the institutions must
be such that they will be looked upon by the community
not merely as a place to which the insane may be sent
for final disposition, but as hospitals where the development
of mental diseases may be prevented and where recoveries
may be reasonably expected if the patient is
given early treatment. This should be the principal object
of the state hospital of the future. "The concept of
its beneficent ministration to the mind diseased as any
physical part of the human body," as Copp<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30">
</a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> has
pointed out, "is just appearing in shadowy outline in
public consciousness. The effacement of this barrier to
early treatment is slowly but steadily progressing. Its
pace will be hastened if every mental hospital continues
to become, as speedily as may be, the real hospital in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
broadest sense, with emphasis laid upon its treatment
function and subordination of its control relation within
the reasonable limit of caution. The mental hospital and
the general hospital are essentially alike. Mental factors
predominate in the former, but are potent influences
in the latter. The difference is one of degree only. All
the imperative requirements of the one must be met by
the other. They are supplementary agencies in curing
and alleviating disease and must be, eventually, viewed
in the same light and administered in the same spirit on
even planes of humaneness and efficiency."</p>

<p>One thing should be made clear at the outset. A comprehensive
and progressive program for further development
means an expenditure of money. If the state hospitals
are to fulfill their obligations to the community
which they serve they must have more physicians. Provisions
must be made for directors of clinical psychiatry,
pathologists, internists, surgeons, dentists, and specialists
of various kinds. Experts in hydrotherapy, massage
and electrical treatments are necessary, as well as dietitians,
industrial instructors, occupational teachers, specialists
in reeducational work, psychologists, social workers,
etc. Furthermore, they must be provided in sufficient
numbers if anything is to be accomplished. As a matter
of fact, no very great outlay of funds would be required
in making a tremendous increase in efficiency. Although
the institutional expenditures have increased enormously
of late years, largely as a result of war conditions, increased
costs, higher wages, etc., the amount actually
invested in this humanitarian movement by the various
states is not commensurate in any way with the results
which are to be obtained. If we leave out of consideration
everything except the saving in dollars and cents to
be effected by methods which will in many instances
render a protracted hospital residence unnecessary, the
outlay involved would be well warranted. It should be<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
brought to the attention of the public that very few
states are expending as much as one dollar per day for
the maintenance of the individual patient. Modern hospital
treatment of the highest type, under these circumstances,
is manifestly impossible. The time has come
when we should no longer be satisfied with the purely
custodial care of mental cases.</p>

<span class="st">THE HOSPITAL TREATMENT OF MENTAL
DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p2">The responsibility of the hospital for the future of the
patient begins with his arrival at the institution and the
ultimate outcome of the case often depends entirely upon
the developments of the first few weeks of his residence
in the wards. A complete understanding of the patient's
mental condition, the prospects of an ultimate recovery
and the line of treatment to be followed can only be
determined by a thorough and accurate examination on
admission. This constitutes the basis for all further procedure.
If satisfactory results are to be obtained this
task should be delegated to a medical officer who has had
an extended psychiatric experience. For purposes of
completeness, as well as uniformity, a definite plan should
be followed. The form used in writing the initial history
and in recording the results of the routine mental and
physical examinations at the Boston State Hospital are
described in full in the "Medical Staff Manual" which
is furnished to all assistant physicians entering the service.
This has been found to be of great assistance in
the training of new men along proper lines and insures
a uniformity of hospital records which is indispensable.
In a general way the form of examination employed by
Meyer and Kirby<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> for some years has been followed.
As this scheme is fairly representative of the method of
procedure used by hospitals for mental diseases throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the country it has been thought worth while to reproduce
it in full.</p>

<p class="p11"><i>Family History</i>:</p>

<p class="ph">It is not sufficient to ask simply the general question: Has
any member of the family been insane or nervous? A great
many persons will answer in the negative, whereas a detailed

<p class="ph">Very important because certain of the non-organic psychoses
appear to be a further development of mental traits or tendencies
early recognized as personal peculiarities or deviations
from the normal. In addition to the points already covered
under the preceding headings, the following important types
should always be borne in mind and appropriate inquiries made:</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Manic make-up</i>: Lively, active, sociable, pushing, talkative,
cheerful, optimistic; may be domineering, irritable and inclined
to cruelty; sometimes not very efficient, may be noted as changeable,
lacking in persistence, concentration and application.
May show transient blue spells or lowering of spirits.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Depressive make-up</i>: Gloomy, worrisome, blue natures who
feel continuously inhibited or restrained and unable to make decisions;
easily discouraged.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Cyclothymic make-up</i>: Emotionally unstable, either up or
down, have blue spells or are unduly cheerful and care-free.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Shut-in make-up</i>: Shy, retiring, self-conscious, bashful,
quiet, secretive, seclusive and unsociable. Lack of interest in
opposite sex or definite aversion; often prudish and over-particular.
Unusual religious interest frequent. Inclined to day-dreaming,
show fondness for the abstract and mystical. Odd
habits, hobbies or cranky pursuits are common.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Paranoid make-up</i>: Mistrustful, suspicious, tend to misunderstand;
unduly sensitive, feel discriminated against and have
feelings of self-importance. (These traits may be related to
shut-in tendencies.)</p>

<p class="ph">Other types of make-up include the psychasthenic, neurasthenic
and hysterical; also the mentally retarded or undeveloped
(feebleminded).</p>

<p class="p11">8. <i>Previous Attacks of Mental Disorder</i>:</p>

<p class="ph">Obtain dates, places where treated, apparent cause, duration
of attacks and general character of symptoms.</p>

<p class="p11">9. <i>Precipitating Cause of Present Psychosis</i>:</p>

<p class="ph">Try to determine what occurrence or situation appeared to
bring about the mental breakdown. Emotional strains, excitement,
quarrels, worries, griefs, disappointments, sexual episodes,
separation, deaths, childbirth, etc., financial loss, overwork,
physical disease, etc.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<p class="p11">10. <i>Onset and Symptoms of the Psychosis</i>:</p>

<p class="ph">Take as far as possible a spontaneous account beginning
with date when first symptoms were noticed in the patient. In
this connection particular attention should be given to changes
in behavior, in mood, in manner of speech, in attitude towards
others and towards work.</p>

<p class="ph">Appearance of suspicious, unusual interests, peculiar ideas
and delusions?</p>

<p class="ph">Hallucinations in various fields and reaction to them?</p>

<p class="ph">Obtain as much as possible regarding trend of patient's
ideas, topics of conversation and content of hallucinations.
What did voices say? What was seen in visions?</p>

<p class="ph">Forgetfulness, impairment of memory, loss of orientation
and clouding of sensorium.</p>

<p class="ph">Always inquire regarding suicidal inclinations or attempts,
threats of violence, assaults or homicidal tendencies.</p>

<p class="ph">Compare informant's statement with those given in the commitment
certificate.</p>

<p class="ph">What treatment was given at home? Name of physician
in attendance?</p>

<p class="st3">VIII. <i>SUMMARY</i>: Physical and mental.</p>


<p class="st3">IX. <i>DIFFERENTIAL AND PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">The question as to what benefit is to be derived by
the patient from a residence in a hospital for mental diseases
is one which is often raised by relatives and
friends. They are quite inclined to feel that if no medicines
are being prescribed nothing is being done for the
patient and that he could be cared for just as well at
home. In considering this question it should be borne
in mind that the persons under treatment in a hospital
for mental diseases are there, either because they appreciate
the need of hospital care themselves, or because,
as a result of mental disorders, they are incapable
of directing their own affairs, or are, in the eyes of the
law, dangerous to themselves or others. Their property
and other legal interests must be protected during their
period of incompetence. Such persons are liable, if
not adequately safeguarded, to enter into improper contracts
or make legal conveyances that mean financial
ruin to themselves as well as others. Unfortunate sexual
irregularities frequently occur. Conduct disorders
of various kinds are to be expected and a tendency
towards criminal acts is common to several of the psychoses.
It is a well-known fact that every mentally unbalanced
individual is potentially dangerous, no matter
how harmless he may appear. The suicide rate of the
country as shown in one hundred of the largest cities has
not fallen below fourteen per hundred thousand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sane population at any time during the last twenty
years. The homicide rate in thirty-one of our large
cities has not dropped below eight per hundred thousand
of the population since 1909. Many of these crimes were
undoubtedly committed by persons who should not have
been at large and who were not responsible for their
acts. The most important benefit derived by the patient
in the hospital is the constant personal supervision given
him by experts throughout the twenty-four hours of the
day, whether he is asleep or awake. He gets the benefit
of regular hours of rest and exercise, a properly regulated
diet adapted to his needs, a sufficient amount of
fresh air, and amusement and entertainments suited to
his mental condition. He receives competent medical,
dental and nursing care and is provided with opportunities
for occupying himself in many different ways.
Reading matter is always available for those who care
for it. Even religious services are held for his benefit.</p>

<p>The tendency of late years is to dispense with the
use of drugs as far as possible and resort to other methods
of accomplishing the same results. One of the most
important therapeutic procedures in common use in the
modern hospital for mental diseases is hydrotherapy.
This should be used intelligently if any results are expected.
Sending the patient to the hydriatic department
where identically the same treatment is applied to all
cases whether of excitement, depression, exhaustion, etc.,
by an attendant who has no knowledge of either medicine,
psychiatry or nursing may be referred to as the application
of water to the exterior, but it is not hydrotherapy.
Hydriatic treatments should be prescribed by a physician
who has a thorough familiarity with that particular
therapeutic procedure and every patient should receive
the form adapted to his individual needs. The
treatment should be given by an expert hydrotherapist.
The equipment should provide for hot air, electric light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
vapor and saline baths, Sitz baths, circular, rain, fan, jet
and Scotch douches, dry, hot and cold packs, etc. Much
can be accomplished by tonic, stimulating and eliminative
therapy. Sedative treatments are much used in
hospitals for mental diseases. The hot air bath<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is
given at from 134 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit for from
four to ten minutes, preceded by a foot bath at from
104 to 110 degrees. The patient enters the electric light
and vapor bath at the room temperature, the baths being
continued from four to eight minutes usually. The
needle spray is given at a temperature ranging from 96
to 102 degrees, with a pressure of from twenty to thirty
pounds, and continued from one to two minutes. The
fan douche starts at 90 degrees, is reduced gradually
with a pressure of from twenty to twenty-five pounds and
is continued for from fifteen to twenty seconds. The
jet douche is first used at 90 degrees and gradually reduced,
with a pressure of from fifteen to twenty-five
pounds, for from ten to twenty seconds. The Scotch
douche is used at a temperature of 80 degrees alternating
with 110, with from fifteen to thirty pounds pressure.
It should be used with extreme care. The same is true
of vapor douches. The saline bath contains five pounds
of ordinary salt to sixty gallons of water at a temperature
of 94 degrees and is continued from ten to thirty
minutes. The dry pack is usually continued from twenty
to forty-five minutes, although it may be used longer
with safety. In the use of the hot blanket pack the inner
blanket is wrung out of water at from 140 to 160 degrees
and must be applied with great care. Depending on the
condition of the patient, etc., the cold wet pack is given
with sheets wrung out of water at a temperature ranging
from 50 to 60 degrees, although lower temperature
may be used. "Neutral" wet sheet packs are often used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at a temperature of from 100 to 116 degrees for approximately
three-quarters of an hour, as preparatory treatments.
These measures should never be attempted by
anyone who has not had an extended practical experience.
Much can be accomplished by hydrotherapy in
the alcoholic and toxic conditions, infective and exhaustive
psychoses, manic excitements, involutional melancholia,
hysterical and neurasthenic conditions, as well as
in occasional cases of dementia praecox. Occupational
therapy has been used to great advantage in connection
with the hydrotherapeutic treatments.</p>

<p>In the reception service and in the buildings for the
noisy and violent cases ample facilities should be at
hand for the continuous bath treatments. Pack rooms
are also desirable. There is no means at our disposal
equal in any way to the efficacy of the continuous bath
in controlling excitements. The patient is usually kept
in the tub from five to eight hours at a temperature
varying from 92 to 97 degrees and averaging 96 degrees.
In some hospitals they are kept in the tubs for periods
of from two to three weeks. The continuous bath is
of no value unless it means what the name implies&mdash;the
continuous submersion of the body in water. In dealing
with very excited cases this necessitates the use of a
tub cover and a hammock, although sheet coverings are
often used satisfactorily. Not much is to be gained by
the tub bath if the patient is to be allowed to get out
and in as he pleases and only come into partial contact
with the water. The continuous bath is not without
drawbacks. There is danger of chilling, scalding and
drowning either by accident or with suicidal intent, etc.
Too much care cannot be exercised in the supervision of
the bath rooms. Every tub room in the Boston State
Hospital has the following rules conspicuously <span class="no-break">displayed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<div class="pagebreak"><p class="sta">THE CONTINUOUS BATH ROOM</p></div>

<p class="ph3">1. The nurse on duty in the bath room will be held personally
responsible for the safety of the patients and must be
thoroughly familiar with these rules. The nurse must
never leave the room unless relieved by some other nurse.
Eternal vigilance is necessary to prevent the chilling, scalding
or drowning of the patient.</p>

<p class="ph3">2. Patients are to be given continuous baths only on the written
order of a physician.</p>

<p class="ph3">3. Patients going to or from the bath room must wear a nightdress
or bathrobe and slippers when not fully clothed.</p>

<p class="ph3">4. Tubs not in good condition or not properly equipped must
not be used.</p>

<p class="ph3">5. Only patients under treatment are allowed in the room.</p>

<p class="ph3">6. Toilet each patient just before the bath. Patients may be
removed from the tub for toilet purposes when necessary.</p>

<p class="ph3">7. In preparing for the bath, warm the tubs with hot water
and then regulate the temperature so that a small amount
of water at 96 degrees will be flowing continually.</p>

<p class="ph3">8. Adjust the hammock to the tub and place the patient in the
bath resting on the hammock. Adjust the cover to the
tub, with patient's head through the neck opening unless
sheets or other covers are used.</p>

<p class="ph3">9. The temperature of the water must be taken in each tub at
least every half hour. Feel the water in each tub frequently.
If it seems too warm or too cold, take the temperature
at once. If you find it varying from 96 degrees
adjust to that temperature by adding a small amount of hot
or cold water. If the temperature cannot be kept between
95 and 97 degrees, let the water out of the tub and remove
the patient immediately. The physician in charge and
the chief engineer should be notified at once. The bath
tub key must be fastened to a special cord worn by the
nurse on duty. It must be delivered to the nurse in charge
of the ward when the bathroom is closed.</p>

<p class="ph3">10. If the patient is very noisy, restless or flushed, fasten an
ice poultice to the tub cover so that as the patient lies in
the water the back of the head or neck will rest upon it.
Replace with a fresh one before the ice is entirely melted.</p>

<p class="ph4">Intensely excited patients may have cold compresses to
the neck, changed often, for periods of 20 minutes.</p>

<p class="ph4">Sponge all faces with cold water once an hour.</p>

<p class="ph3">11. Patients are to be permitted to drink as much cool water
(not iced) as they desire, and must be offered a drink at
least once an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph3">12. The nurse must record the following: 1. The water temperature
and the patient's pulse rate (temporal or facial)
every half hour. 2. The amount of sleep in the bath. 3.
Bowel movements. 4. Nourishment. 5. Medicine administered.
6. Hours of each patient in the tub. 7. The name
of each nurse and the exact time of going on or off duty.</p>

<p class="ph3">13. In case the patient shows symptoms of fainting or convulsions,
makes any attempt at drowning, shows suicidal tendencies
or becomes too violent to remain in the tub with
safety, let the water out and remove the patient at once.</p>

<p class="ph3">14. In the event of any serious accident or injury or sudden
illness the patient should be removed from the tub at once
and the physician notified.</p>

<p class="ph3">15. Patients are not to be allowed to feed themselves but must
always be fed by the nurse. The inlets to the bath may be
closed for twenty minutes while patients are being fed.</p>

<p class="ph3">16. During the day the warming closet must always contain
one sheet and one towel for each patient in preparation for
drying. It must also contain washable rugs for patients
coming out of the tubs to step upon; also two blankets for
emergencies.</p>

<p class="ph3">At least one hour before the patients are to be removed
from the baths the garments they are to wear after the
bath must be placed in the closet.</p>

<p class="ph3">17. The temperature of the room should be kept as nearly as
possible at 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature of
the room cannot be kept above 68 degrees discontinue the
bathing.</p>

<p class="p2">When the care and treatment of mental diseases was
first undertaken in our state institutions it was soon
found necessary to take advantage in every way of such
material assistance as could be offered by the more
intelligent class of ablebodied patients in carrying on the
routine work of the hospital. There were never employees
enough to dispense with their services. In this
way it came about that they were employed in the farms
and gardens, assisted with the kitchen and housework,
shared the tasks of the nurses and attendants in the
wards and were busily engaged in almost every department
of the hospital activities. It became apparent that
occupation, undertaken originally for purely economical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
purposes, constituted one of the most important therapeutic
agents at the disposal of the institution. The
next step was the development of industries. Patients
were taught by instructors to make clothing, underwear,
stockings, shoes, brooms, mats, brushes, mattresses, furniture
and many other useful products needed by the
hospital. The end products were in every instance utilitarian.
These accomplishments led to a still further
development&mdash;purely occupational in character. Women
were encouraged to take up such activities as rug making
of all varieties, basketry, weaving, crocheting, embroidery,
and needlework of every description. Men
usually make towelling on looms, weave rugs, renovate
mattresses, do repairing of all sorts and manufacture
small articles which interest the masculine mind. Brass
work, clay modelling and making jewelry of various kinds
have been extensively employed.</p>

<p>All of these forms of employment mean, of course,
that the patient must leave the ward and go to some
place designed for the purpose. The others, however,
have not been overlooked and occupational therapists,
who devote their entire time to stimulating the interest
of the patients who cannot leave the wards, on account of
their mental or physical condition, in some absorbing
and diverting occupation, are an important part of the
personnel of every institution. No other form of treatment
employed in hospitals for mental diseases has been
so productive of results. It is interesting to note that
the medical officers of all of the forces engaged in the
recent war found that occupational therapy was of great
value in cases of shell shock and war neuroses.</p>

<p>The highest development perhaps of occupational
therapy has been in its application to strictly reeducational
work in dementia praecox. This consists in a
graduated and systematized reeducation of interests in
apparently deteriorated individuals. The success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
these efforts depends largely on the fact that very simple
lines are followed at first. The patients are interested
in marching to music, simple drills, calisthenics,
games, basketball and purely physical exercises. Some
can be induced to sort out raffia and ultimately take part
in basket making. Others cut out pictures or put puzzles
together. The women sometimes are willing to do
plain sewing or make paper flowers. They progress by
easy stages to more advanced and elaborate undertakings
leading eventually to occupational work in the wards
or possibly in the industrial rooms. Some of the apparently
most hopeless cases have, as a result of these
reeducational efforts, been able to return to their homes
greatly improved. The mental improvement goes hand
in hand with a resumption of their interests in their
former work or some new occupational venture which
may have proved attractive.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to avoid the possibility
of long hours of idleness in the wards. When not actively
employed in occupational work, ward games,
reading, etc., the patients should be taken out of doors
for fresh air and exercise. This, of course, suggests the
necessity and importance of attractive surroundings.
Nothing can be more depressive or detrimental to the
welfare of the patient than a prisonlike appearance either
inside of the buildings or on the grounds. The successful
operation of a hospital is dependent in no small
measure on the amount of attention devoted to the preparation
of food. There must be a general dietary for
the active ablebodied class, one for the working patients,
an entirely different one for the tuberculous and epileptic
cases and a special diet for the strictly hospital
wards. In an institution of any size this requires the
constant supervision of several dietitians.</p>

<p>The advances of recent years in our knowledge as
to the etiology and nature of general paresis have led<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the introduction of highly specialized therapeutic
methods in the treatment of that disease and of cerebro-spinal
syphilis. This is an important feature of the work
of our hospitals at the present time. The interest recently
shown in the study of the endocrine system has
already brought about a new line of therapy which is
destined to receive much attention in the future.</p>

<p>Even the amusements necessary for the individual
are given special attention in the treatment of mental
diseases. This refers not only to methods of recreation
and diversion in the wards day by day but includes moving
picture shows, dances and various other special
entertainments. Not the least important consideration
is the patient's bodily health. This is often a determining
factor in bringing about a restoration of mental integrity.
It very often happens that there are diseases
of the eye, ear, nose, throat, skin, nervous system, etc.,
which may require attention. Dental, surgical, gynecological
and other special treatments sometimes prevent
ordinarily acute and recoverable psychoses from terminating
unfavorably.</p>

<p>In a word, the modern hospital treatment of mental
diseases may be said to consist of a direct personal
supervision of the mental and physical hygiene of the
patient, supplemented by such specialized therapeutic
procedures as may be indicated in the individual case.</p>

<span class="st">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PSYCHOPATHIC
HOSPITAL</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p2">As has already been shown, the modern hospital treatment
of mental diseases in this country is a development
which represents the progress of nearly two centuries.
Satisfactory as this has been in many respects, it nevertheless
leaves much to be desired. All indications point
to much greater accomplishments in the future. We are
emerging from an era of custodial care and entering
one of prevention, scientific investigation, and highly
specialized treatment along entirely different lines. The
interest of the public has been aroused in a subject which
has heretofore been one to be avoided by common consent.
Mental hygiene societies are no longer viewed
with suspicion and curiosity. We are approaching a
time when mental diseases can be dealt with, as other
conditions are, without prejudice or unjust discrimination.
Psychiatric wards promise to become integral
parts of a completed medical organization. Psychopathic
hospitals will soon be found in all of our great
centers of population. The outlook for specialized institutes
for purely research purposes, unfortunately, is
not so encouraging at this time.</p>

<p>At last there is some evidence of progress in the
teaching of psychiatry in medical schools, hospitals and
clinics, although only a beginning has been made as yet.
More noteworthy advances have been made in other
countries. The appointment of Heinroth as a professor
of psychiatry at Leipsic in 1811 promised developments
which did not materialize to any great extent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
many years. According to Sibbald,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> psychiatric wards
or clinics were established at Würzburg in 1833,
Jena in 1848, Vienna in 1853, Berlin in 1865 and at
Göttingen in 1866. Scholz made provision for observation
wards in a general hospital in Bremen in 1875.
Fürstner opened a psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg in
1878. Hitzig accomplished the same thing at Halle in
1891 and Siemerling at Kiel in 1901. The inception of the
modern psychiatric clinic has generally been attributed
to Griesinger.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In his preface to volume one of the
"Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten" in
1868 he advocated the establishment of small hospitals in
cities for the intensive treatment of acute and recoverable
mental cases. He recommended a large staff of physicians
and accommodation for from sixty to eighty patients,
according to the needs of the community, but not
to exceed one hundred and fifty under any circumstances.
"In close connection with the organization of such institutions
there is a crying need and a new, most important
interest&mdash;the question of psychiatrical instruction.
This is absolutely indispensable." This he proposed to
accomplish by establishing a highly specialized clinic to
be maintained largely by the teaching staff of a university.
Griesinger's ideas were eventually carried out
in full by Ziehen in Berlin, Sommer in Giessen and Bleuler
in Zurich. Perhaps nothing has had more to do with
the development of psychopathic hospitals in the United
States than the well-known clinic established by Kraepelin
at Munich in 1905. It occupies a three-story building
accommodating one hundred patients and cares for
between fifteen hundred and two thousand cases annually.
Hydrotherapeutic and electrical treatments are used extensively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain number of beds are reserved for
research purposes. Psychological studies receive a
great deal of attention. The out-patient department
is a prominent feature. The teaching of
psychiatry is one of the important purposes of
the clinic. Kraepelin's methods have been followed
rather closely here. The remarks made by Pliny
Earle<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in 1867 were almost prophetic in character.
"Carbon agglomerated is charcoal, carbon crystallized
is diamond. What charcoal is to the diamond,
such, I believe, is the psychopathic hospital of the present
compared with the psychopathic hospital of the
future.... When the defects which I have mentioned
shall have been thoroughly remedied by a comprehensive
curriculum, a complete organization, a perfect systematization,
an efficient administration, the charcoal now
just ready to begin the process of crystallization will
have become the diamond and the world will possess the
psychopathic hospital of the future."</p>

<p>Psychiatric research was inaugurated in this country
by the establishment of the Pathological Institute of the
New York State Hospitals in New York City in 1896.
Its original field of investigation was limited to the laboratory.
The name was changed to "Psychiatric Institute"
on the appointment of Dr. Adolf Meyer as director
in 1902 and the establishment was removed to Wards
Island, where it was provided with clinical facilities by
the Manhattan State Hospital. It thus became the precursor
of the psychiatric clinic movement in America.
The observation wards for the examination and commitment
of mental cases, at the Philadelphia Hospital
(1890) and at Bellevue in New York City were probably
the first of the kind in this country. In 1902 the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
psychopathic wards connected with a general hospital
were opened by the Albany Hospital. Pavilion F, as it
was designated, admitted 3,132 patients during its first
twelve and one-half years. These included persons
awaiting examination and commitment, voluntary patients
and cases of delirium, stupor, etc., transferred
from other wards of the hospital. Of 1,038 cases admitted
during a period of six years, only 17.6 per cent
were committed to state hospitals. In a total of 1,855
cases, twenty-five per cent were found to be suffering
from some form of alcoholism and twenty-six per cent
from chronic mental conditions, while thirty-five per
cent were cases of the acute and recoverable class.
About fourteen per cent were psychoses associated with
renal conditions, neurasthenia, hysteria, tuberculosis or
traumatism.</p>

<p>The Psychopathic Hospital at the University of Michigan,
the first of its kind on this continent, was established
at Ann Arbor in 1906 as a direct result of the
activities of Dr. William J. Herdman. The objects and
purposes of the hospital were shown by the provision of
the legislature for the appointment of "an experienced
investigator in clinical psychiatry, who shall be placed
in charge of the psychopathic ward, whose duty it shall
be to conduct the clinical and pathological investigations
therein; to direct the treatment of such patients as are
inmates of the psychopathic ward; to guide and direct
the work of clinical and pathological research in the several
asylums of the state, and to instruct the students of
the State University in diseases of the mind." It was
thus an integral part of the hospital of the University
of Michigan but fully coordinated with the state institutions.
A subsequent act of the legislature changed its
status to that of a "State hospital, specially equipped
and administered for the care, observation and treatment
of insanity and for persons who are afflicted mentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but are not insane." It also provided that a clinical
pathological laboratory should be maintained for the
benefit of the state hospitals. During a period of eleven
years it admitted an average of 168.82 patients per
year. Twenty-four per cent of these were voluntary
cases. The psychoses represented were: manic-depressive
insanity, twenty-four per cent; dementia praecox,
seventeen per cent; paranoid conditions, two per cent;
hysteria, seven per cent; psychopathic personality, two
per cent; alcoholic psychoses, four per cent; morphine
intoxication, one per cent; imbecility, two per cent; general
paralysis, eight per cent; cerebral syphilis, one per
cent; epilepsy, two per cent; senile psychoses, one per
cent; cerebral arteriosclerosis, three per cent; unclassified
conditions, five per cent; and not insane, two per
cent. Seventy-four per cent of all the cases admitted
were discharged after a residence of three months or
less and eighty-two per cent after a residence of four
months or less. Fourteen and eight-tenths per cent of
all cases were discharged as recovered and 32.7 per cent
as improved. Owing to the fact that it has only sixty-two
beds at its disposal, the number of admissions is
necessarily limited and cases are carefully selected.</p>

<p>The Psychopathic Hospital in Boston, the first institution
of the kind established in this country as a department
of a state hospital (The Psychopathic Department
of the Boston State Hospital), was opened for the
reception of patients in 1912. The purposes of the institution
were very clearly shown by the Twelfth Annual
Report of the Massachusetts State Board of Insanity
(1910):&mdash;"The psychopathic hospital should receive all
classes of mental patients for first care, examination and
observation, and provide short, intensive treatment of
incipient, acute and curable insanity. Its capacity should
be small, not exceeding such requirement. An adequate
staff of physicians, investigators and trained workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in every department should provide as high a standard
of efficiency as that of the best general and special hospitals,
or that in any field of medical science. Ample
facilities should be available for the treatment of mental
and nervous conditions, the clinical study of patients
on the wards, and scientific investigation in well-equipped
laboratories, with a view to prevention and cure of mental
disease and addition to the knowledge of insanity and
associated problems. Clinical instruction should be
given to medical students, the future family physicians,
who would thus be taught to recognize and treat mental
disease in its earliest stages, when curative measures
avail most. Such a hospital, therefore, should be accessible
to medical schools, other hospitals, clinics and laboratories.
It should be a center of education and training
of physicians, nurses, investigators, and special
workers in this and allied fields of work. Its out-patient
department should afford free consultation to the poor,
and such advice and medical treatment as would, with
the aid of district nursing, promote the home care of
mental patients. Its social workers should facilitate
early discharge and after care of patients, and investigate
their previous history, habits, home and working
conditions and environment, heredity and other causes
of insanity, and endeavor to apply corrective and preventive
measures."</p>

<p>The building has a capacity of one hundred and ten
beds. The institution may be said to differ from other
psychopathic hospitals in being an establishment essentially
of the temporary care type, not designed primarily
either for the reception or for the care and custody
of obviously committable cases, but rather for the
observation and treatment of incipient mental disorders
as well as psychopathic conditions not properly coming
within the scope of the state hospitals. It has been as
a rule the policy of the court to commit directly to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
institutions for the insane all cases showing clearly the
necessity of an extended hospital residence. The fact
that only forty per cent of the temporary care cases have
been committed shows that a preliminary period of observation
before these cases are definitely disposed of is
unquestionably warranted. The legal status of cases
admitted may be described as follows:&mdash;1. Temporary
care (not to exceed ten days); 2. Boston Police cases
(Persons suffering from delirium, mania, mental confusion,
delusions or hallucinations, or who come under
the care or protection of the police); 3. Observation
cases (for a period of thirty-five days, pending commitment);
4. Cases pending examination and hearing;
5. Emergency commitments (not more than five days);
6. Voluntary admissions; 7. Cases held under complaint
or indictment.</p>

<p>An analysis of the work done by the Psychopathic
Department from 1912 to 1920 shows a total of 14,922
admissions to the wards,&mdash;an average of 1,865 per year.
Of these, 59.77 per cent were temporary care (10 day)
cases, 18.56 per cent "Boston Police" cases, 1.38 per
cent observation cases (thirty-five days), .50 per cent
emergency cases, .61 per cent committed "pending examination
and hearing," 1.02 per cent under complaint
or indictment and 16.96 per cent were voluntary cases.
The entire temporary care group, including all of the
above classes except the voluntary and criminal cases,
constituted 81.34 per cent of the admissions. It is interesting
to note that the principal psychoses represented
by the cases coming into the hands of the Boston Police
are dementia praecox, alcoholic psychoses and mental
deficiency. The number of emergency cases is very
small, as is the number committed by courts for observation.
The number of voluntary admissions, an average
of 316 per year, constituting 16.96 per cent of the total,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is very significant as showing the response to be expected
from the public to an opportunity for hospital
treatment without the formality of any legal procedure.
Of the 14,922 cases admitted between 1912 and 1920,
38.45 per cent were subsequently committed as insane and
3,797, or 25.44 per cent, were returned to the community
as not requiring further hospital care or treatment.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the special field covered by
the Boston Psychopathic Hospital consists of temporary
care cases. The principal psychoses represented by
12,252 admissions of that class were as follows: alcoholic
psychoses, 9.25 per cent; dementia praecox, 25.0 per cent;
senile psychoses, 3.16 per cent; general paresis, 6.06 per
cent; manic-depressive psychoses, 10.14 per cent; arteriosclerosis,
3.23 per cent; epilepsy, 1.85 per cent; and
without psychoses, 20.63 per cent.</p>

<p>This latter class (without psychosis) is looked upon
by some as constituting the most important field of a
psychopathic hospital. It is exceedingly interesting to
note the conditions which bring such individuals to the
institution. An analysis of 1,430 cases shows the principal
mental types represented to be as follows:&mdash;mental
deficiency, thirty-four per cent; psychopathic personality,
15.17 per cent; hysteria, neurasthenia and other
psychoneuroses, 11.2 per cent; epilepsy, 8.04 per cent;
alcoholism, 6.08 per cent; conduct disorders, 4.2 per cent;
syphilis, 2.03 per cent; organic brain diseases, 1.68 per
cent; neurosyphilis, 1.26 per cent; drug addictions, 1.4
per cent; somatic conditions, 1.19 per cent, etc.</p>

<p>No less interesting and instructive is a study of the
voluntary cases. An analysis of 1,807 admissions of
this type shows the following distribution of psychoses:
alcoholic psychoses, 5.64 per cent; dementia praecox,
18.43 per cent; manic-depressive, 6.81 per cent; involution
melancholia, .99 per cent; senile psychoses, 1.11 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
cent; general paresis, 7.9 per cent; epilepsy, 1.05 per
cent; psychoneuroses, 3.59 per cent; and without psychosis,
34.64 per cent.</p>

<p>The work of the out-patient service includes in a general
way the study of cases referred to that department
from the wards of the hospital or by its social service
staff; cases referred by courts, schools, social agencies,
and other institutions, as well as those sent by practicing
physicians and individuals coming on their own initiative.
The response on the part of the public to the facilities
offered by the out-patient department is shown by
the fact that 9,273 new cases were reported during a
seven-year period, an average of 1,324.7 per year.
Fifty-seven and six hundredths per cent of these cases
were adults, 17.8 per cent were classified as adolescents,
24.25 per cent as children and .89 per cent as infants.
The source of origin of these cases is exceedingly interesting.
Four and eighty-seven hundredths per cent were
referred to the out-patient service by courts; 4.65 per
cent, by schools; 11.77 per cent, by hospitals; 9.77 per
cent, by physicians; and 3.55 per cent, by individuals.
Fifteen and five tenths per cent came from the wards
of the Psychopathic Hospital; 9.96 per cent, from the
social service department and 13.3 per cent came on
their own initiative. The question as to why these cases
are sent to an institution of the psychopathic hospital
type can now be answered. Fourteen and fifty-two hundredths
per cent were examined solely for the purpose
of determining the existence of probable mental diseases
and 21.88 per cent on account of suspected mental
defects. Four and fifty-two hundredths per cent were
sex offenders. In 8.64 per cent the only question at issue
was the possibility of a psychoneurosis and in 7.97 per
cent the purpose of the examination was to ascertain
whether or not syphilis was present. The diagnoses
show the nature of the cases encountered in an out-patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
mental clinic. Four and eighteen hundredths per
cent were cases of dementia praecox; 1.7 per cent of alcoholism;
2.26 per cent of alcoholic psychoses; 2.39 per
cent of epilepsy; 15.72 per cent of mental deficiency;
9.0 per cent of psychoneuroses; 2.14 per cent of manic-depressive
insanity; 2.09 per cent of psychopathic personality;
1.21 per cent of general paresis; and 2.94 per
cent were unclassified. Two and thirty-two hundredths
per cent were diagnosed as suffering from syphilis in
some form and 6.27 per cent were either delinquent,
defective, subnormal, retarded or distinctly feebleminded.
In 3.76 per cent no disease was found, either
mental or physical. The great bulk of these cases were
diagnosed either as mental deficiency, psychopathic personality
or epilepsy. The ultimate disposition of 2,741
cases, covering a period of two years, serves as an index
of the practical operation of such a department. In
42.03 per cent of these cases no care or observation other
than that of the out-patient department was required.
In 1.69 per cent of the cases commitment was recommended
to hospitals for mental diseases, in 7.15 per cent,
to schools for the feebleminded and in .11 per cent, to
penal institutions. General or psychopathic hospital
care was recommended in 11.31 per cent. In 2.74 per
cent of the cases a report was made to courts; in 1.61
per cent, to schools; in 18.75 per cent, to social agencies;
and in 1.13 per cent, to physicians.</p>

<p>The functions of the social service department in a
general way may be summarized as follows:&mdash;1. The
after care and supervision of patients at home; 2. Advice
to families of patients in regard to their cases; 3. Advice
given other members of the family; 4. Financial relief;
5. Reference to other social agencies or institutions;
6. Information obtained for case histories; 7. Inquiries
relative to home conditions when discharge of a patient
is under consideration, etc. The routine operation of<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the department is well illustrated by the annual report
of the Boston State Hospital for 1920. The number
under social service supervision during the year was 428.
Of these, 278 were new cases. Thirty-two and thirty-seven
hundredths per cent were referred by the out-patient
physicians; 59.71 per cent by the ward service;
7.19 per cent by other social agencies; and .73 per cent
were brought by relatives or friends. The principal
reasons for their reference to the social service workers
were shown as follows:&mdash;For medical history, 50.36 per
cent; assistance in securing employment, 9.35 per cent;
financial aid, 3.6 per cent; supervision, 7.2 per cent;
advice, 19.42 per cent; convalescent care, 2.87 per cent;
home care, 2.87 per cent, etc. An analysis of the cases
under supervision shows the principal psychoses represented
to be as follows:&mdash;Arteriosclerosis, 1.8 per cent;
general paresis, 4.68 per cent; alcoholic psychoses, 1.8
per cent; manic-depressive psychoses, 4.68 per cent;
dementia praecox, 16.55 per cent; paranoid conditions,
4.31 per cent; psychoneuroses, 9.35 per cent; undiagnosed
psychoses, 6.84 per cent; and without psychoses, 44.24
per cent. This latter group was made up mostly of psychopathic
personalities (28.45 per cent) and mental
deficiency (26.29 per cent). The purely social problems
presenting themselves in connection with these cases
were reported as follows:&mdash;Mental disease, 75.54 per
cent; physical disease, 2.16 per cent; poverty, 2.88 per
cent; criminality, 3.24 per cent; juvenile delinquency,
2.52 per cent; sex offenses, 2.16 per cent; alcoholism, 2.16
per cent; family dissension, 6.12 per cent; ignorance,
2.52 per cent; and bad environment, .36 per cent. In
addition to this, 299 discharged soldiers and 543 out-patient
cases were reported as being under the supervision
of the department, as well as 532 special cases
studied in connection with the investigation of syphilis.</p>

<p>The Psychopathic Hospital in Boston started on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
new chapter in its history on December 1, 1920, at which
time it was formally separated from the Boston State
Hospital and became a separate institution under the
direction of Dr. C. Macfie Campbell.</p>

<p>The Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at the Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore was established in 1913. An
integral part of a large general hospital and intimately
associated with a medical school, it conforms rather
closely to the plan of the German psychiatric clinics.
A study of its activities shows that during a period of
five years (ending January 31, 1918) the admission rate
averaged 403.8 per year. Fourteen and three-tenths per
cent of the cases were diagnosed as dementia praecox
or schizophrenic reaction and 13.7 per cent conform apparently
to the classification of manic-depressive psychoses.
Ten and five-tenths per cent were diagnosed
as neuroses or psychoneuroses; 6.1 per cent as general
paresis; fifteen per cent as agitated depressions; 2.3 per
cent as alcoholic psychoses; and 6.1 per cent as constitutional
inferiority or constitutional psychopathic states.
Seven and nine-tenths per cent were cases of anxiety
neuroses, agitated depressions or anxiety psychoses;
2.3 per cent were paranoic states or reactions; 3.5 per
cent were cases of alcoholism, and 3.7 per cent of drug
habits. The dispensary service of the Phipps Clinic has
reported an average of 565 cases per year, representing
a total of 2,260.5 visits annually.</p>

<p>The work of Drs. Meyer, Hoch and Kirby at the Psychiatric
Institute, of Dr. Barrett at the Psychopathic
Hospital at the University of Michigan, of Dr. Southard
at the Psychopathic Department of the Boston State
Hospital, and that of Drs. Meyer and Campbell at the
Phipps Psychiatric Clinic in Baltimore has brought the
subject of psychopathic hospitals very prominently before
the public. Various other establishments of a similar
nature have been planned and some are in process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of construction, or already in operation. The State
Psychopathic Institute at Chicago and the Psychopathic
Hospital of the University of Iowa should be mentioned
in this connection. Psychopathic hospitals have been
planned for New York City and one is to be built by the
State of California. The legislature of Colorado has
already made an appropriation of $350,000 for the establishment
of an institution of this type in the city of
Denver.</p>

<p>The work already done in this field shows quite conclusively
that general hospital methods are not inconsistent
with the developments of modern psychiatric
progress. The large percentage of voluntary cases received
and the number of persons consulting the physicians
in the out-patient departments shows an
unexpected demand on the part of the public for institutions
of a new type. As Dr. Adolf Meyer<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> has
pointed out, "Our organized system for the care of
mental disorder is in many respects forbidding. It
throws together all kinds of diseases, and shocks in that
way the already sensitive patient who fears the worst
for himself or herself. It comes at once with an outspoken
declaration of insanity in the very commitment
to a hospital, an expression which carries a humiliation
to the patient and adds insult to injury. It often means
carrying the patient off to a remote asylum which is too
widely supposed to have the inscription, 'Leave hope
behind all ye that enter here.' Helpfulness rather than
coercion must take the place of all this." What the psychiatric
clinic may be expected to accomplish in remedying
this difficulty was summarized by Dr. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in
the following words:&mdash;"It is eminently necessary to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
model institutions in which medical students and physicians
can learn how to deal with the many problems
of the disorders of the organ of behaviour from their
inceptions into all their ramifications. The clinic must
do the work for at least one limited district, with its out-patient
and social service and consultation department,
and with its hospital wards. Everything must be done
to make help in mental disorders more acceptable and
convincingly helpful. More patients must learn to look
to it for help and the organization must be so as to give
the patient and the physician and the public at large a
conception very different from that to-day associated
with insanity. It is not so much the issue of more help
to the curable, but the issue of more work near where
the troubles begin, and work against that which breeds
trouble. For this we must learn to put the chief weight
on hospitals and organizations for natural districts for
intensive work rather than upon the mere economy of
large hospitals far away from where the troubles develop."</p>

<p>Southard has raised the question as to the correct
designation of institutions of the psychopathic hospital
type:&mdash;"A word is again necessary as to the meaning
of the term 'psychopathic hospital.' For various reasons
the term has become so attractive in propaganda
that a comparatively large number of institutions of
whatever scope have been founded or recommended to
receive the term 'psychopathic hospital,' 'institute,'
'department' or 'ward.' Thus there is developing a tendency
in state hospitals to denominate the receiving ward
'psychopathic.' There can be no advantage in this designation
other than that of calling old ideas by new names.
The idea of the receiving ward for committed cases
destined to receive the ordinary probate court group of
cases is not altered or improved in any manner by the
designation 'psychopathic.' The best opinion seems to<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
be that a psychopathic hospital or institute shall be an
institution in which all types of mental cases, from the
probate court group on the one hand up to the most
dubious and difficult cases of mental disorder on the
other, may be examined; but if an institution is primarily
or chiefly concerned with patients of the medicolegal,
committable or custodial group, to serve merely as a vestibule
through which committed cases pass, such an institution
has by no means the broad scope which the very
general term 'psychopathic' implies. The institution
is not a modified or sublimated form of receiving ward
for a great district hospital."</p>

<p>There is, of course, no reason why the reception service
of an ordinary state hospital should be spoken of
as constituting a psychopathic ward. This accomplishes
nothing more, perhaps, than to raise some question as to
what the functions of the rest of the institution may
be. The designation psychopathic hospital has been
rather loosely used and is, as Southard has definitely
shown, of American origin. It has been applied somewhat
indiscriminately from time to time to practically
every form of activity related to the care and treatment
of mental diseases outside of the generally recognized
state hospital field. These may be summarized as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Detention wards, pavilions, etc. Intended for
no purpose other than the custody of the "insane" pending
commitment.</p>

<p>2. Psychiatric wards of general hospitals&mdash;such as
Pavilion F in Albany. There would appear to be no
reason for the use of the word psychopathic in such
cases, the term psychiatric being much more clearly
applicable.</p>

<p>3. Institutes designed primarily for research only
or for research and instruction, with or without clinical
facilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Psychopathic hospitals. Independent units or integral
parts of a general hospital&mdash;with or without
facilities for research and instruction. Designed exclusively
for mental cases, without regard to legal status,
whether committed or voluntary, their detailed examination
and careful observation with intensive treatment
in the wards for limited periods when indicated, or their
supervision and direction in out-patient departments,
serving also in some instances as receiving and distributing
centers supplying other institutions.</p>

<p>Owing to their limited size, the necessity of treating
large numbers in a short space of time, and the fact that
institutional care is already amply provided for in the
existing state hospitals, the obvious field of the psychopathic
hospital is primarily the acute and recoverable
psychoses and the milder forms of mental disorder which
may or may not require a residence in the wards. Only
a thorough examination and a brief period of observation
can determine whether or not that is needed. The question
at issue is largely that of determining the necessity
of a more or less indefinite committed status. These
problems arise particularly in dealing with the so-called
psychogenic disorders and the psychopathic states&mdash;hysteria,
neurasthenia, psychasthenia, the psychoneuroses
in general and the episodes which characterize the
psychopathic personalities. Traumatic psychoses often
come into consideration, as well as cases of cerebrospinal
syphilis, toxic conditions, drug addictions, the
psychoses of infection and exhaustion, and above all, of
course, manic-depressive insanity and incipient forms of
dementia praecox. Many of these cases require only a
brief hospital treatment and are able in a short time
to return to home surroundings and resume their former
occupations. Often a contact with the chronic and custodial
classes is not only without advantage but actually
detrimental. The psychopathic hospitals thus exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a sort of clearing house function and return to the community
many patients who otherwise would be subjected
to the stigma, if there is one, of a legal commitment.
While questions relating to the public health cannot be
analyzed in terms of dollars and cents, the saving to the
state which is made by substituting a short period of
supervision and treatment, for a protracted residence in
an institution of the custodial class amounts to millions.
In view of the difficulties encountered in obtaining adequate
appropriations for the proper maintenance of the
enormous population now housed in our state hospitals,
this is a factor which cannot be disregarded.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<span class="st">THE MENTAL HYGIENE MOVEMENT</span></h3>
</div>

<p>As the result of an intimate personal knowledge of
the subject, acquired during an extended hospital residence
as a patient in both public and private institutions,
Clifford W. Beers, having recovered his health, resumed
his place in the world profoundly impressed with the
feeling that the question of mental diseases as a public
health problem was one which demanded immediate consideration.
In no position financially to institute a campaign
for the purpose of interesting the public in the
importance of topics which had not been made the subject
of general discussion in the past, he was confronted
with the necessity of securing the cooperation and support
of persons who had the means to launch such an
undertaking. With this object in view he wrote his
book&mdash;"A Mind That Found Itself,"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> now in its fourth
edition and destined, to use the words of the "American
Journal of Insanity,"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "to become one of the classics
of psychological literature." There is some question
as to the accuracy with which Mr. Beers analyzed the
experiences through which he had passed. Although there
is no reason for questioning his mental condition when
the book was written, his conclusions were apparently
formulated when he had not as yet had sufficient time in
which to readjust himself and recover his perspective.
Some of his viewpoints certainly reflect a morbid coloring
of which he was probably unconscious, although at
the time he recognized in himself "symptoms hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
distinguishable from those which had obtained eight
months earlier when it had been deemed expedient temporarily
to restrict my freedom." His work was referred
to as an "autopathography" by Farrar,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who
made a detailed study of the various psychological
trends manifested. These are more or less immaterial.
The interesting feature of his book is the elaborate description
of a common but exceedingly important psychosis
written by a well educated observer with a
collegiate training. Its greatest value, however, lies in
the fact that he brings home to us so graphically the
overwhelming importance of the personal element so
often overlooked by those who are accustomed to dealing
with mental cases in large numbers. "It carries the
reader away from the technical dissertations, and brings
him face to face with the feelings and reactions of a
distorted mind, showing him the patient as a human
being with a sentient soul and not as a case."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>That the plan which Mr. Beers had formulated for
an organized mental hygiene movement had a practical
application was recognized at once by Dr. Adolf
Meyer,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who expressed the following views on the subject
as early as 1907:&mdash;"It will be a difficult task to
find the not very common level-headed and well-informed
persons in various parts of the country capable of organizing
the public conscience of the people. Neglected
by physicians and dreaded by the fiscal authorities, the
facts are not available today, except in fragments, mixed
up with innumerable extraneous considerations; the hospitals
are closed corporations, the press injudicious in
inquiry and reform, and those capable of judgment
unable to get the facts. The crying needs persist in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
meantime. Instead of a land fund (the 12,225,000 acres
bill and ideal of Dorothea Dix) we must have a permanent
survey of the facts and efficient handling of what
is not prevented. The experience with what remains as
inevitable experiments of nature, as well as with people
who should know better, must be put into practical form
for communication and teaching, and brought home
where it will tell; in opportunities of work and education
for physicians, and cooperation between our educational
forces and those who labor for physical hygiene and
prophylaxis. Most of us are already under too definite
obligations to meet the call for devoted work for the
maintenance of an organization as well as can Mr. Beers.
In my judgment, he deserves the assistance which will
make it possible for others to join in the work which will
be one of the greatest achievements of this country and
of this century,&mdash;less sensational than the breaking of
chains but more far-reaching and also more exacting in
labor. A Society for Mental Hygiene with a capable
and devoted and judicious agent of organization will
put an end to the work of makeshift and short-sighted
opportunism, and initiate work of prevention and of helping
the existing hospitals to attain what they should
attain, and further of adding those links which are needed
to put an end to conditions almost unfit for publication.
What officialism will never do alone must be helped along
by an organized body of persons who have set their
hearts on serious devotion to the cause. If Mr. Beers
gets the means to pursue his aim he will secure the
body which will guarantee proper judgment in a cause
which has been a mere foster-child in the field of charitable
donations merely because it seemed too difficult.
Here is a man who is not afraid of the task. May he get
the help to enable him to surround himself with the best
wisdom of our nation!"</p>

<p>Encouraged by this and many other such expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of opinion, Mr. Beers proceeded to the organization of
the first state mental hygiene society, that of Connecticut,
which began its activities in 1908. The National
Committee for Mental Hygiene was formally organized
on February 19, 1909. The first few years were devoted
to raising funds and making comprehensive preparations
for further activities which did not start until 1912. In
the meanwhile the cooperation of many prominent philanthropists,
educators, physicians, etc., was assured. The
importance of this movement is illustrated by the
prominence of the persons who were willing to associate
themselves with an undertaking of this nature. The
membership of the committee has included, in addition
to many others, Professor William James, Dr. Lewellys
F. Barker, Dr. Rupert Blue, Dr. George Blumer, Dr. G.
Alder Blumer, Professor Russell H. Chittenden, Ex-President
Charles W. Eliot, President W. H. P. Faunce,
President John H. Finley, Professor Irving Fisher, Dr.
Charles H. Frazier, Cardinal Gibbons, President Arthur
T. Hadley, Chancellor David Starr Jordan, President
Cyrus Northrop, Dr. Stewart Paton, Dr. Frederick
Peterson, Professor Gifford Pinchot, President Jacob
G. Sherman, Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes, Mrs. William K.
Vanderbilt, Professor Henry VanDyke, Dr. William H.
Welch and Ex-President Benjamin Ide Wheeler. Important
financial contributions were made by Professor
William James, Mr. Jacob A. Riis, Mr. Henry Phipps,
Mrs. Elizabeth M. Anderson, Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt,
Mrs. E. H. Harriman, Mrs. Willard Straight, the
Rockefeller Foundation, etc. With the appointment of
Dr. Thomas W. Salmon as Medical Director in 1912 the
committee commenced active operations with its future
success assured in every way.</p>

<p>The objects and purposes of the National Committee
have been very adequately summarized in the following
language used in one of its publications:&mdash;"The National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Committee for Mental Hygiene and its affiliated
state societies and committees are organized to work for
the conservation of mental health; to help prevent nervous
and mental disorders and mental defect; to help
raise the standards of care and treatment for those suffering
from any of these disorders or mental defect;
to secure and disseminate reliable information on these
subjects and also on mental factors involved in problems
related to industry, education, delinquency, dependency,
and the like; to aid ex-service men disabled in the war;
to cooperate with the federal, state, and local agencies
and with officials and with public and private agencies
whose work is in any way related to that of a society or
committee for mental hygiene. Though methods vary,
these organizations seek to accomplish their purposes by
means of education, encouraging psychiatric social service,
conducting surveys, promoting legislation, and
through cooperation with the many agencies whose work
touches at one point or another the field of mental
hygiene. When one considers the large groups of people
who may be benefited by organized work in mental
hygiene, the importance of the movement at once becomes
apparent. Such work is not only for the mentally
disordered and those suffering from mental defect, but
for all those who, through mental causes, are unable so
to adjust themselves to their environment as to live
happy and efficient lives." The first few years of the
committee's existence have demonstrated conclusively
that it is the most powerful factor in promoting the welfare
and interests of the insane in this country since the
time of Dorothea Dix. The elaborate surveys which it
has made of conditions existing in various states have
resulted in beneficial legislation which had been needed
for years. Surveys have been completed in California,
Tennessee, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Connecticut,
Georgia, Wisconsin and South Carolina, and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
are under way. It has brought about an interest in
mental diseases and mental defects such as has never
been manifested before in this country. Its activities
during the early part of the war were responsible
largely, if not entirely, for the attention given by the
Army and Navy to matters relating to psychiatry. The
National Committee has taken a very active part in encouraging
the establishment of psychiatric clinics in
connection with the state hospitals. It has been largely
responsible for the psychological and psychiatric examination
of defectives in penal institutions and reformatories
now generally recognized as being of vital importance.
Its activities have emphasized the importance of
a preliminary mental examination of obviously defective
individuals brought before the courts. One of its accomplishments
has been the publication of a very successful
quarterly magazine, "Mental Hygiene," which was
undertaken in 1917 and has long since passed the experimental
stage. A summary of its activities would not be
complete without a reference to the valuable work which
the committee has done in standardizing the reports made
of institutions and compiling accurate statistics relating
to mental diseases and defects which will be of inestimable
value to all who are interested in the progress of
psychiatry in this country.</p>

<p>State mental hygiene societies now exist in Alabama,
California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Tennessee and Virginia. The committee on mental hygiene
in New York is a department of the State Charities
Aid Association, which has been actively interested in
matters relating to the care and treatment of the insane
for many years. The chief purposes of the state organizations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have been officially described as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> "To
work for the conservation of mental health; for the prevention
of mental diseases and mental deficiency and for
improvement in the care and treatment of those suffering
from nervous or mental diseases or mental deficiency."
The interest of the public is stimulated by pamphlets,
reports and publications of various kinds, mental
hygiene exhibits of an educational nature, public lectures,
mental hygiene conferences, etc. The local societies
have as a definite object, moreover, the encouragement
of<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> "(a) Out-patient departments for mental
cases in connection with hospitals for mental diseases and
general hospitals, and independent of either of these
agencies, such, for instance, as dispensaries and mental
hygiene clinics, (b) Systematic psychiatric as well as
psychological examination of school children, (e) Provision
for incipient and emergency cases in psychopathic
wards of general hospitals, (d) Psychopathic hospitals
in which cases of mental disorder may be treated
in their earliest and most curable stages and where practical
work in prevention and social service may be done,
(e) Increased institutional provision for the feebleminded
and epileptic." One of their most important
objects is the enactment of laws in the various states
which will take care of the insane pending commitment
out of the hands of the poor authorities and delegate it
to health officers or physicians. As Dr. William L. Russell<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
has pointed out, the mere provision of institutional
care for the mental diseases of a community is not
the only thing to be considered, "Unless the vital issues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
occasioned by mental disorders in the homes, the schools,
the industries, and in social relations are intelligently
grasped and dealt with by means of the state system,
state institutions are liable to be looked upon as a resource
which is only to be appealed to when complete
separation of the patient from his usual environment has
become imperative. They will still be regarded as
asylums. In such case, their development is likely to be
in the direction of great custodial centers, and economic
and so-called business consideration in their management
are likely to prevail over those dictated by science
and humanity. This has happened in more than one
state in which state care has been adopted under conditions
of great promise. A system of state care must, to
be effective, not only be adopted, but it must be planned
and developed with reference to the known needs of the
sufferers from mental disorder."</p>

<p>The Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene,
the second national organization of this type, was
established at Ottawa on April 26, 1918, largely as a
result of the activities of Dr. Clarence M. Hincks of
Toronto University. Arrangements were at once
effected for an active participation in war work, a comprehensive
study of immigration, elaborate statistical
institutional studies, the establishment of a library,
special investigation of delinquency and a series of lectures
to be given in various parts of the Dominion. This
organization has been an exceedingly active one from the
beginning. The first number of the "Canadian Journal
of Mental Hygiene" appeared early in 1919. A survey
was made of Manitoba and its needs during the first year.
The University of Toronto announced an extension
course beginning April, 1919, for the special training of
social workers desiring to enter the mental hygiene field.
Instruction was given in psychiatry, social and economic
problems, neurology, mental tests, case work, social institutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
occupational therapy, child welfare, home economics
and recreation. In 1919 a mental hygiene survey
was made of British Columbia. Alberta, New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia have already requested similar
surveys with the intention of improving the methods of
caring for mental diseases and defects in those provinces.
Psychiatric clinics have been established in connection
with the Toronto University and the Royal Victoria
Hospital in Quebec. New institutions have been planned
in British Columbia and a psychopathic hospital is to be
built in Toronto. In 1920 a mental hygiene committee
was instituted in France<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> by the Minister of Hygiene,
Assistance and Social Providence. The committee is
made up of about forty members, psychiatrists, pathologists,
physiologists, managers and magistrates. Dr.
Dron, Senator and Mayor of Tourcoing, was elected
chairman. The committee is to make a study of all questions
relating to mental hygiene and psychiatry. It will
consider particularly methods of coordinating the activities
of various organizations already at work, the creation
of new interests and spreading broadcast information
on mental hygiene topics. A representative of this
society has already made a visit to this country to study
methods employed here. The mental hygiene movement
has even reached South Africa. "Mental Hygiene"<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
has called attention to the fact that the Cape Province
Society for Mental Hygiene has actively interested itself
in the provisions discussed by the government for the
care, education and training of the feebleminded. Two
institutions are to be opened for this purpose. The Cape
Province Society has already instituted a campaign for
the purpose of organizing other local societies as well as
a national council.</p>

<p>When Mr. Beers wrote his well-known book he evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had in mind more particularly the amelioration of
material conditions existing in institutions. He was
looking forward to provision for the more humane and
scientific care of mental diseases. This is unquestionably
a consideration of vital importance and these
objects have not been neglected in the practical operation
of the mental hygiene organizations. Mental hygiene
in its broadest sense, however, has come to mean much
more than that. The foundation of the present-day conception
of mental hygiene may be said to have been laid
by Adolf Meyer in 1906, when he described the fundamental
principles which he believed to be concerned in
the development of dementia praecox. He saw in this
disease a disorder of the personality due to a deterioration
of mental habits, in other words, to faulty mental
hygiene. While his views as to the etiology of dementia
praecox have not been generally accepted, they suggested
an entirely new avenue of approach to the problem of
mental diseases in general. Hoch's "shut in" personality
and Bleuler's "autismus" were more or less comparable
hypotheses which do warrant to a certain extent
the tenability of such theories as were advanced by
Meyer. The same may be said of some of the mental
mechanisms advocated by Freud and others of the more
purely psychological school of psychiatrists. This viewpoint
is reflected somewhat by White<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in his conception
of childhood as the golden period for mental
hygiene. "The outstanding fact that present-day psychiatry
emphasizes is that mental illness is a type of
reaction of the individual to his problems of adjustment
which is conditioned by two factors&mdash;the nature of those
problems and the character equipment with which they
are met.... Mental illnesses, defects of adjustment at
the psychological level, are therefore dependent upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
defects in the personality make-up, and as this personality
make-up is what it is as a result of its development
from infancy onward, it follows that the foundation of
those defects which later issue in mental illness are to
be found in the past history of that development." He
protests very properly against accepting the theory that
the characteristics of the personality are entirely the
products of germ-plasm determiners moulded in strict
accordance with the laws of heredity and therefore immutable.</p>

<p>Copp<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> has called attention to the fact that the
dominant figure in mental hygiene activities must eventually
be the family physician, who has an opportunity
to see the beginnings of mental disorders when they first
manifest themselves. He must, therefore, be qualified to
intelligently understand such conditions and be prepared
to suggest a remedy. His is inevitably the first point of
contact. Mental hygienists have found a fertile and
almost untouched field in our public school system. As
Professor Burnham<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> suggests, "It is a grave reflection
upon the schools that so many of their graduates
have to be reeducated in the sanitarium or the hospital."
The hygiene movement in the school population, as suggested
by Professor Gesell,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> means something more
than psychological examinations and mental tests, important
as they are. It means a study of the individual.
He would have a new type of school nurse or social
worker, one interested particularly in "the child with
the night terrors, the nail biter, the over-tearful child,
the over-silent child, the stammering child, the extremely
indifferent child, the pervert, the infantile child, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
unstable choreic, and a whole host of suffering, frustrated
and unhealthily constituted growing minds, that
we are barely aware of in a quantitative sense, because
we do not have the agencies to bring them to our attention
as problems of public hygiene and prophylaxis."
They require highly specialized supervision and training
if they are not to become future residents of our hospitals
for mental diseases or possibly of institutions of
a reformatory type. If such reforms as these are to be
brought about in our public school system it is hardly
necessary to suggest that the teacher herself must have
very clear conceptions as to the significance and importance
of mental training in youth.</p>

<p>If these matters are important in the public schools
they must be even more serious factors in higher education.
Campbell<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> has raised the question as to how
far the universities "fulfill their responsibilities with
regard to the mental hygiene of the community? It is
doubtful whether they have attained a clear recognition
of the fact that a man's mind may be richly supplied with
a great variety of special information, that he may have
attained a high intellectual level, and yet the man's life
may be rendered inefficient because it rests upon insecure
foundations. An education may enable a man to solve
abstruse intellectual problems, and yet leave him so hopelessly
unable to cope with a bereavement, an unsuccessful
love affair, difficult marriage relations, or even simple
instructive impulses that he may lose control of the
direction of his life and for a period be dominated by
factors which have been almost entirely repressed in
his conscious life; the disorder may be so marked as to
be included under the wide term "insanity." To rear a
superb intellectual structure on such a foundation is
surely not an ideal education; it is like building a house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on the sand, or, to speak more hygienically, it is like
building a superb mansion without paying any attention
to the plumbing." Deplorable as it may seem that such
important elements in the education of the individual
have been overlooked, it is not nearly so surprising as
the fact that no instruction of any consequence is given
in psychiatry in the great majority of our medical
schools. This is a matter which is well worthy of attention
and is fortunately beginning to receive some consideration.
A rather systematic campaign has been instituted
by the mental hygiene organizations to bring about
some instruction in these topics in our schools and
universities,&mdash;a campaign which promises to be productive
of results sooner or later.</p>

<p>An interesting phase of the mental hygiene movement
is the relation which it has been shown to hold to the
field of industry. It must be admitted that this is an
intensely practical question. We even have a Journal
of Industrial Hygiene, which has been published successfully
now for some time. The mere taking of intelligence
tests for industrial purposes is only an incident.
The important thing, as shown by Cobb,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> is the prevention
of mental disorder by bringing about a proper
relation of the worker to his environment and the
elimination of causes of discontent. Beyond this there
is, of course, the early treatment of individuals before
the opportunity of bringing about a proper adjustment
has been lost for all time. Cobb<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> suggests that, above
all, the physician must "forget orthodox psychiatry (as
the economist seems to be forgetting cut-and-dried political
economy) and interest himself in a dynamic, individual
psychology which recognizes the essentials of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
human nature and at last begins to analyze for us the
elements of which human nature really consists, looking
on each case as a human experiment in reaction to environment."</p>

<p>There would appear to be no limit to the possibilities
of the mental hygiene movement. Perhaps no more comprehensive
summary of its objects and purposes can be
given at this time than that contained in a definition
recently formulated by Southard:<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> "To stem the
tide of syphilis, to wage war on alcohol, to counsel
against marriage of defectives, to generalize the insane
hospitals, to specialize the general hospitals, to weed
defects out of general school classes, to open out the
shut-in personality, to ventilate sex questions, to perturb
and at the same time reassure the interested public&mdash;these
are infinitives that belong perhaps in a rational
movement for mental hygiene. They are things the past
has taught us more or less clearly to do and in that
sense the movement for mental hygiene is surely not
much more than the elaboration of the obvious."</p>

<p>It may be suggested that these are functions which
properly belong to the medical profession exclusively.
A little reflection will, however, be sufficient to show that
this is not the case. Efforts have been made for years
to prevent the spread of venereal disease. Attempts
were made to accomplish this by legislative enactment.
That these methods of control have been ineffectual is
now well known to everyone. Continental governments
have for a long while been trying to regulate prostitution
by police supervision and frequent medical inspections.
The percentage of venereal disease has, however,
not been appreciably reduced by this plan and it has
been repeatedly condemned by vice commissions as a
result of official investigations. It may be stated now, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
think, without fear of contradiction that this is a matter
which must be regulated by educating the public and
which can be handled in no other way. It is a well
known fact that no law can be enforced unless it meets
with public approval. The will of the majority rules.
When the effects of venereal disease are generally recognized
there will no longer be a necessity for much
legislation on the subject. This is a question of far-reaching
importance. When it is recalled that twelve
per cent of the cases admitted to our hospitals for mental
diseases are suffering from general paresis or cerebral
syphilis, the necessity of a more general understanding
of these conditions is readily apparent. The percentage
is much higher in the densely populated metropolitan
districts.</p>

<p>Legislative restrictions in the past were never very
successful in limiting the use of alcoholic beverages. It
is true that the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States and the Volstead Act have had
a very material effect on the number of cases of alcoholism
admitted to our institutions. The influences which
resulted in alcoholism, however, will find an outlet in
some other direction unless they are modified in some
way. This again is largely a matter of education. There
never was a time in the history of the country when a
knowledge of the effect of drugs of various kinds on
the nervous system was as important as it is today.</p>

<p>The history of the movement to prevent the marriage
of mental defectives is more or less familiar to all. The
sentiment of the community is apparently not such at
this time as to encourage the regulation of the marriage
of the mentally or physically unfit by legislative restrictions.
Attempts to do so have been almost a flat failure.
Various states have passed laws providing for the
sterilization of defective delinquents. These laws, generally
speaking, have accomplished nothing because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
public sentiment was not behind them. All of these matters
have been brought to the attention of the public by
prominent speakers on numerous occasions. Frequent
articles have been printed in medical journals, well-known
periodicals, and even in the daily papers. Attention
has been called to the mental clinics established
here and there and repeated reference has been made to
the fact that physicians at our state hospitals may be
consulted at any time on questions pertaining to mental
diseases or mental defects.</p>

<p>Something has been accomplished along these lines.
It is unfortunate that, as a rule, people look with more or
less suspicion upon institutions which are even now generally
referred to as asylums. There are many who
still believe that every hospital for mental diseases has
its padded cells and underground dungeons. There is
a rather widespread idea that the most common causes
of insanity are cigarette smoking, religion and self abuse.
Even in our most progressive communities it has been
difficult, if not impossible, to entirely prevent the temporary
detention, at least, of mental cases in jails and
police stations. Very few general hospitals have psychopathic
wards or any realization as to the necessity
of establishing them. It is not to be denied that in many
states the care of the mentally ill in our public institutions
is far from being what it should be in this enlightened
day. These are conditions that cannot be remedied
by the medical profession without the active assistance
of leaders of public sentiment. The fact that the importance
of these questions is recognized by prominent
educators, business men, lawyers, and other persons active
in the affairs of the community, and well known to
the public, will accomplish more than articles in the medical
journals by physicians. This constitutes the great
field of the mental hygiene organizations. They will
mould public sentiment as nothing else ever has, in matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which relate to the mental health of the country.
They will influence legislation where it is needed in a way
that no medical society can hope to do. Above all, they
can in time bring the public face to face with the fact
that mental diseases should be discussed, generally understood
and prevented, instead of being merely concealed
and misrepresented. Possibly it would not be
looking too far into the future to express the hope that
an organization composed largely of laymen may be able
eventually to accomplish something that the medical profession
has never been able to do,&mdash;induce those who
frame our laws to provide medical treatment for defective
delinquents instead of merely locking them up
for the protection of society. It would seem, moreover,
that the time has come when the public should insist that
the mental condition of persons accused of crime be made
a medical rather than a legal question exclusively.</p>

<span class="st">THE ETIOLOGY OF MENTAL DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>In reviewing the history of medicine there is nothing
more discouraging than the references found in literature
to the views entertained from time to time relative to
the cause of mental diseases. To a certain extent this
may be looked upon as an index of the progress of civilization.
It must be admitted that it is at the same time,
nevertheless, a reflection upon the medical profession
which has never shown the interest in psychiatry that the
importance of the subject warrants. It has been suggested
that mental diseases did not play a prominent
part in ancient history, owing to the fact that the law of
the survival of the fittest automatically eliminated the
insane and defective. As Tuke<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> says, "They perished
in the course of nature, or were stamped out of existence;
many of the perverse and morally insane were stoned
to death; war destroyed a large number of feeble persons;
while the Romans deliberately, and in the interests
of the race, threw down from the Tarpeian Rock the
children who were unfit to live." The papyri of the fifteenth
century before Christ show clearly that the doctrine
of demoniacal possession was generally entertained
at that time.</p>

<p>One of the earliest attempts to explain the origin of
mental diseases perhaps was that of Plato. "There are
two kinds of madness, one arising from human diseases,
the other from an inspired deviation from established
custom." Hippocrates<a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> had some very clearly defined
views on this subject: "As long as the brain is at rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a man enjoys his reason; but the depravement of the
brain arises from phlegm and bile, either of which you
may recognise in this manner: Those who are mad
from phlegm are quiet, and do not cry out or make a
noise, but those from bile are vociferous, malignant, and
will not be quiet, but are always doing something improper.
If the madness be constant, these are the causes
thereof; but if terrors and fears assail, they are connected
with derangement of the brain, and derangement
is owing to its being heated. And it is heated by bile
when it is determined to the brain along the blood-vessels
running from the trunk, and fear is present until it return
again to the veins and trunk, when it ceases. He is
grieved and troubled when the brain is unreasonably
cooled and contracted beyond its wont. It suffers this
from phlegm, and from the same affection the patient
becomes oblivious." An interesting theory which he
evolved was that the appearance of varicose veins or
hemorrhoids tended to relieve the patient's mental suffering.
Celsus subscribed to the black bile doctrine. Galen's
teaching was that fatuity was due to moisture, while
dryness produced sagacity. In cases where the whole
body contained melancholy blood he recommended venesection.
Thick and black wine was to be avoided, "as
from it the melancholy humour is made."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This he described
as a condition of the blood "thickened, and more
like black bile, which exhaling to the brain, causes melancholy
symptoms to affect the mind." The Roman custom
of appealing to the household gods, sons of the Goddess
of Madness, was quite significant. Horace, in speaking
of Orestes, says: "Was he not driven into frenzy
by those wicked Furies, before he pierced his mother's
throat with the reeking point of his sword? Nay, from
the time that Orestes passed for being unsound of mind
he did nothing in any way to be condemned; he never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
dared wound with his sword either his friend Pylades
or his sister Electra; he merely abused both, calling one
a Fury, the other some other name suggested by his active
or bright bile." In the story of Argive, Horace says
that "his relations cured him with much labour and care,
by expelling the disease and the bile by doses of pure
hellebore."</p>

<p>Little progress was made, if any, by the time of the
Christian era. In fact, as Clouston<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> says, "The mental
pathology of the New Testament and of the early ages of
Christianity was founded on the idea that the disease
was a possession of the devil, and the feeling towards
this afflicted class of human beings was naturally that of
repulsion and hatred, their treatment following on those
lines. Neglect, the whip, chains, confinement in stone
cells, starvation, unsuitable medical treatment, speedy
death were the natural results."</p>

<p>Passing to the seventeenth century we find that Sennert,
a professor in Wittenberg, believed that maniacs
evacuated stones, iron, living animals, etc., things not
produced in the natural body and therefore caused by
demons. He also believed firmly in witchcraft. Thomas
Willis (1682) is said by some to have been one of the
first to suggest a relation between insanity and pathological
changes in the brain. Prochaska in 1784 went so
far as to say, "We think, with Haller, that no light can
be thrown upon it in any other way than by a careful
dissection of the brains of fatuous persons, apoplectics,
and such as have other disorders of the understanding."
It would appear to have been the belief of Pinel that the
primary seat of disease in mental conditions was in
the stomach and intestinal tract. Spreading from these
centers it caused a derangement of the mind when the
brain became involved. The influence of the moon, as
well as the stars, was spoken of by Hippocrates and admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
by Galen. To these ideas we owe the word lunacy
which appeared in the laws of England in 1320 and may
be found there today.</p>

<p>The influence of the moon on the mind was taken quite
seriously. Rush seems to have been somewhat in doubt
on this subject and suggested the probability of there being
a kind of sixth sense involved&mdash;a perception of the
state of the air, and of light and darkness, as Pritchard
expressed it, to which we are insensible in health. It
was thought that the full moon, by rarefying the air,
increased the amount of light, thus affecting the mind.
Dr. Rush noted that during an eclipse of the sun in 1806
"there was a sudden and total silence in all the cells of
the hospital." He expressed the opinion in his "Medical
Inquiries and Observations" in 1812 that there are
few cases in which the insane feel the influence of the
moon and that the excitement resulting in such cases is
to be attributed to the resulting increase of light. It is
interesting to note that von Feuchtersleben, an eminent
German writer, in 1845 was unwilling to go on record as
stating positively that the moon was not a factor in the
causation of insanity. Esquirol, in his "Maladies Mentales,"
in 1838, branded this belief as a superstition, but
admitted that there were certain facts which could not
be overlooked. "It is true that the insane are more agitated
at the full moon as they are also at the dawn of
day; but is it not the bright light of the moon that excites
them, as that of the day every morning? Nevertheless,
an opinion which has existed for ages&mdash;which has spread
over all lands, and which is consecrated by popular language&mdash;demands
the most careful attention of observers."
Dr. Allen of the York Lunatic Asylum was very
firmly of the opinion that the moon had a decided influence
on the time of death in mental diseases. This question
was given very serious consideration by various
writers as late as 1856.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile efforts were being made to ascertain
the cause of mental disease by means of pathological
researches. Morgagni,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> one of the earlier investigators,
came to the conclusion that the more common lesions
were in the pineal gland, although he found some induration
of the brain and various other well-defined changes.
Arnold (1782) thought that insanity was due to an increased
density of the cerebral substance, particularly,
according to Tuke, "of those parts of the brain by means
of which the soul is connected with the body." Pinel
finally concluded that pathology had practically nothing
to do with the problem and Esquirol in 1838 wrote very
discouragingly on the subject. Early contributions of
considerable importance were made, however, by Foville,
Bayle, Greding, Calmeil, Guislain, Parchappe and others.
These were confined almost entirely to a study of gross
or macroscopic lesions of the brain. Griesinger in 1845
reviewed the pathological changes in the nervous system
quite thoroughly as far as they were known at that time.
It must be admitted that the greater part of our knowledge
of the pathology of mental diseases was acquired
at a much later date.</p>

<p>A very definite indication of the progress, or lack of
progress, made in determining the etiology of the psychoses
is the list of causes agreed upon at the International
Congress of Alienists<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> in 1867:&mdash;1. Physical
causes: Artificial deformities of cranium; convulsions
of infancy and dentition; cerebral congestion (primary,
not that which arises in the course of certain forms of
insanity); organic affections of the brain; senility; pellagra;
anemia; constitutional syphilis; intermittent fever;
typhoid fever; acute rheumatism; gout and chronic rheumatism;
organic affections of the heart; pulmonary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
phthisis; intestinal worms; other acute diseases; other
chronic diseases; suppression of the hemorrhoidal flux;
menstrual disorders; metastasis; alcoholic drinks; abuse
of tobacco; other vegetable poisons; mineral poisons
(lead, mercury, coffee, etc.); insolation; intense heat;
intense cold; blows and falls upon the head; other traumatic
causes. 2. Moral causes: Appertain to religion;
education; love (love thwarted, jealousy); family affections;
fluctuations of fortune; domestic troubles; pride;
disappointed ambition; fright; irritation; anger; wounded
modesty; political events; nostalgia; ennui; misanthropy;
sudden joy; simple imprisonment; solitary confinement.</p>

<p>In 1897 the New York State Commission in Lunacy
in its eighth annual report published an analysis of the
assigned causes of insanity given in 39,369 cases admitted
from 1888 to 1896. Of these 11,999 were reported as unascertained.
In the remaining 27,370 cases the important
"assigned causes" in the order of their frequency were
as follows: Moral causes (including domestic trouble,
loss of friends, business anxieties, pecuniary difficulties,
grief, fright, disappointed affections, disappointed ambition,
political excitement, religious excitement, etc.)
6,608, intemperance in drink 4,763, hereditary predisposition
2,095, old age 1,723, general ill health 1,681, epilepsy
1,605, ill health following overwork 1,092, masturbation
1,063, puerperal (including childbirth and abortion)
773, traumatic 608, climacteric 502, la grippe 442,
sunstroke 402, physical diseases 375, syphilis 368, cerebral
diseases 312, intemperance in drink and narcotics
277, congenital defects 223, shock from injury 167, fever
147, uterine and ovarian disease 132, pregnancy 109,
privation and overwork 110, etc. These are given in detail
not that they throw any light on the question of etiology
but that they are quite significant as to the ideas
prevalent on this subject only a few years ago. In justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to the Commission in Lunacy attention should be called
to the fact that this tabulation does not purport to give
actual causes but those officially "assigned" by the examining
authorities or others interested. Clouston<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> in
1911, in making a statistical study of 11,346 cases admitted
to the Royal Edinburgh Mental Hospital in the
course of thirty-five years, enumerated a long list of
causes shown in the hospital reports. It is interesting
to note that they include nursing, disordered menstruation,
self abuse, sexual excess, surgical operations, bronchitis,
prostatic disease, lupus, commencing menstruation,
transference of morbid action from other organs
to the brain, excessive tobacco smoking, chloroform inhalation,
excessive number of children, religious excitement,
marriage, changes of residence, sedentary habits,
political excitement, bad temper, the Queen's Jubilee,
etc. As he says, "No other disease has anything like this
list of 107 causes. A black and terrible roll it is. Poor
humanity has much to contend with to keep sound in
mind." Analyzing these statistical findings, Clouston
concludes that "bad heredity, congenital defects, and
previous attacks are the great predisposing causes, and
that alcohol, the crises of life, epilepsy, the various forms
of brain poisons and the gross brain and nervous diseases
constitute the mass of exciting causes. Together they
account for over seventy per cent of the defects and diseases
of the mind that come under my observation."</p>

<p>A reference to the statistical reports of the past as
published by the hospitals of this and other countries will
show nothing radically different until within the last few
years. It will readily be observed that fundamentals
were almost entirely lost sight of and nonessentials overemphasized.
Masturbation, for instance, is often a symptom
of dementia praecox and other forms of mental disease,
but is not now looked upon as an important etiological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
factor. The immediate cause, so-called, is usually
a mere incident, often not without some significance,
but bearing little if any definite relation to the fundamental
underlying condition responsible for a mental
breakdown. The studies of Meyer, Hoch, Kraepelin,
Freud, Jung, Bleuler and many others have shown that
in manic-depressive insanity, dementia praecox and various
other psychoses we are dealing with very definite
constitutional conditions, morbid temperaments, personality
defects, etc., which are responsible for the maladjustments
leading to the development of psychoses.
Financial reverses, domestic difficulties, the death of near
relatives, the ordinary hardships and disappointments of
life, even ill health, do not as a rule mean the development
of a psychosis in the normal, properly balanced individual.
In the constitutionally predisposed, the love
affair, the loss of a position, the upsetting factor, whatever
it may be, is merely the "straw that breaks the
camel's back" and is nothing more than an accident of
fate, a pure coincidence. Any other comparatively trifling
occurrence out of the ordinary, any difficult situation
which the makeup of the individual could not adequately
meet and react to, would have accomplished the
same result. There are, however, of course, certain psychic
traumas to which these inadequate personalities are
particularly susceptible.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that without any doubt there
are conditions for which defective heredity is largely responsible.
It is often difficult to determine the actual
rôle which this plays in a given case. Efforts have
been made to reduce the study of these factors to a definite
scientific basis. In 1865 Gregor Mendel,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Abbot of
Brünn, published an account of a series of experiments
made by him with the common pea (pisum sativum)
which was destined to revolutionize our views on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
subject of heredity. On crossing a tall with a dwarf
plant, tall hybrids resulted with no intermediate forms.
This inheritance is said to be due to the presence of a
definite "determiner" in the germ plasm. All of his
hybrids being of the tall variety, he designated that character
as the "dominant," the dwarf being spoken of as
the "recessive." On the fertilization of these hybrids he
obtained another generation, which averages three tall
plants to one dwarf. Further investigation showed that
the dwarfs always bred true, as did about one out of three
of the tall varieties, the remaining two behaving as did
the original hybrids and giving three talls to one dwarf.
He therefore observed that he was dealing with three
varieties of inheritance, the dwarfs which bred true, the
talls which bred true and the talls with a fixed proportion
of talls and dwarfs. The phenomenon as noted by Mendel
is not, however, universal in its application. Curiously
enough no attention was given to Mendel's experiments
until eighteen years after his death, when his work
was rediscovered by de Vries, Correns and Tschermak
in 1900.</p>

<p>Davenport<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> has shown that there are six possible
matings of germ cells as illustrated by the pigment of the
eye:&mdash;1. Both parents, pigmented iris (brown eyes) and
duplex&mdash;all offspring with pigmented iris and duplex;
2. Both parents brown-eyed, one duplex, one simplex&mdash;all
children brown-eyed, but half simplex; 3. One parent
brown-eyed and duplex, the other blue-eyed&mdash;all children
brown-eyed and simplex; 4. Both parents brown-eyed
and simplex&mdash;one-fourth of the children brown-eyed and
duplex, one-half brown-eyed and simplex, and one-fourth
blue-eyed; 5. One parent brown-eyed and simplex, and
the other blue-eyed&mdash;one-half the children brown-eyed
and simplex, the other half blue-eyed; 6. Both parents
blue-eyed&mdash;all children blue-eyed. It should be explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that a duplex origin means the inheritance of a character
from both parents and simplex from only one. The principles
of the Mendelian laws of heredity have been applied
to a study of the color of the eyes and skin, the
color and form of the hair, the stature, body weight
and many other family traits such as musical knowledge,
ability along artistic and literary lines, mechanical
skill, etc. They have also been applied to the study of
various diseases, such as Huntington's chorea, hereditary
ataxia, deaf-mutism, feeblemindedness, epilepsy and insanity,
etc.</p>

<p>Rosanoff<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and Orr have suggested the following hypothesis
relative to the transmission of the neuropathic
constitution as based on the Mendelian theory:&mdash;1. Both
parents being neuropathic, all children will be neuropathic;
2. One parent being normal but with the neuropathic
taint from one grandparent, and the other parent
being neuropathic, half the children will be normal but
capable of transmitting the neuropathic constitution to
their progeny, and half will themselves be neuropathic;
3. One parent being normal and of pure normal ancestry,
and the other parent being neuropathic, all the children
will be normal but capable of transmitting the neuropathic
makeup to their progeny; 4. Both parents being
normal, but each with the neuropathic taint from one
grandparent, one-fourth of the children will be normal
and not capable of transmitting the neuropathic makeup
to their progeny, one-half will be normal but capable of
transmitting the neuropathic makeup, and the remaining
one-fourth will be neuropathic; 5. Both parents being
normal, one of pure normal ancestry and the other with
the neuropathic taint from one grandparent, all the children
will be normal; half of them will be capable and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
half not capable of transmitting the neuropathic makeup
to their progeny; 6. Both parents being normal and
of pure normal ancestry, all the children will be normal
and not capable of transmitting the neuropathic makeup
to their progeny.</p>

<p>Just how much importance is to be attached to these
theories is a difficult matter to determine. A study of a
considerable number of families by Rosanoff<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> would
appear to be very suggestive, although his conclusions
must be looked upon as fairly conservative:&mdash;"On the
whole, taking into consideration the limited amount of material
as well as the various sources of possible error, the
correspondence between the actual findings and theoretical
expectation, as shown in the table, must be regarded as
strikingly close." On the other hand, as White<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> says,
"In dealing with the subject of heredity, however, it must
not be forgotten that our ideas are of necessity largely
founded upon hypotheses, as biological science has not
yet unfolded a sufficient number of facts to make it possible
to tell just how much, in any individual case, must
be attributed to the inherent qualities of the "germ
plasm" and just how much to the influences of environment.
The view which is pretty generally admitted
among biologists at present is that there is little warrant
for the belief in the Lamarckian hypothesis of the inheritance
of acquired characters."</p>

<p>The New York statistical tables on heredity were discontinued
in 1907, at which time a total of 104,013 cases
had been reported. In 31,290 of these no information was
available, leaving a total of 72,622, excluding the not insane.
A history of insanity was shown in the paternal
branch of the family in 8.6 per cent of the ascertained
cases, in the maternal branch in 10.1 per cent, in both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
paternal and maternal in 1.7 per cent, and in collateral
branches in eleven per cent,&mdash;a total of 31.4 per cent in
which some form of heredity was reported. These statistics
relate only to insanity in the family history. There
were so many sources of inaccuracy that it was not
thought worth while to continue these studies after 1907.
Comparisons between the heredity of mental cases and
that of normal individuals have been rather surprising.
Koller, for instance, as quoted by Kraepelin,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in a
comparison of 370 healthy with a similar number of insane
individuals found a history of psychopathic defects in
the immediate families of fifty-nine per cent of the former
and 76.8 per cent of the latter. Diem<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in 1905
made an analysis of the family history of 1193 healthy individuals.
This was compared with 1850 mental cases.
Neuropathic heredity of some kind was found in 78.2 per
cent of the mental cases and 66.9 per cent of the healthy
individuals. There was, however, a history of mental
diseases in the families of 38.3 per cent of the insane patients
as compared with 7.1 per cent of the normal individuals.
Somewhat different results were noted in a
study of the parents. There was a paternal or maternal
history of insanity in 18.1 per cent of the families of the
mental cases as compared with 2.2 per cent in the cases
of the normal individuals. In the direct parentage, Koller
found mental diseases in 57.3 per cent of the families
of the insane as compared with 28 per cent in the case
of normal individuals. Kraepelin states that the influence
of the father is greater in heredity than is that of
the mother. The father, furthermore, usually transmits
to the son while the mother influences the daughter more.</p>

<p>Heredity varies with the psychoses, having its greatest
influence in the transmission of manic-depressive attacks,
epileptic and hysterical conditions, nervousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
compulsive and impulsive insanity, sexual perversions
and morbid personalities (Kraepelin). As the result of
a study of two thousand cases, Pilcz<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> (1907) found that
in alcoholism heredity was most likely to manifest itself
in the form of alcoholism, epilepsy and imbecility or
manic-depressive psychoses. In the progenitors of epileptics
he found epilepsy and migraine. Apoplectics
showed a family history of paralysis, arteriosclerosis,
senile dementia or melancholia. Senile dementia preceded
paralysis, arteriosclerosis, feeblemindedness and
dementia praecox. Tabes and paralysis apparently frequently
precede paralysis and dementia praecox. The
various forms of alcoholic psychoses furthermore show
a tendency to repeat themselves in the offspring of alcoholics.
Similar heredity is said to be the general rule
in manic-depressive psychoses, epilepsy and alcoholism,
and to a less extent in arteriosclerosis. Heredity, in so
far as it is related to mental diseases, may be said to be
largely a question of the transmission of a neuropathic
or psychopathic constitution or predisposition. Various
psychoses are now held to be the direct result of constitutional
causes or hereditary influences. This is probably
true of manic-depressive insanity, Huntington's
chorea, involution melancholia, dementia praecox, paranoia
and paranoid conditions, epileptic psychoses, the
psychoneuroses and neuroses, psychopathic personality
and mental deficiency. It is true that some of these conditions
develop as the immediate results of certain predisposing
factors and that in frequent instances no evidences
of heredity can be found. It is also true that
various authorities maintain that a predisposition to the
development of certain psychoses may be acquired. If,
however, we assume that the above mentioned psychoses
are constitutional in their nature and due primarily to
heredity, it may be definitely stated that, based on recent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
statistical studies, hereditary influences account for from
fifty-five to sixty per cent of the mental cases admitted
to our institutions. It may be pointed out, as an objection
to this suggestion, that although manic-depressive
psychoses often develop in an emotionally unstable or
cyclothymic personality and dementia praecox is associated
with certain peculiarities of makeup, not all of these
cases show clear evidences of constitutional origins.
This is unquestionably true. It is equally true, on the
other hand, that heredity is also probably very often
a factor in the production of the senile and arteriosclerotic
conditions, various nervous diseases, alcoholism and
drug habits.</p>

<p>When we leave the subject of heredity we are on
much more certain ground. There is no question whatever
as to the rôle played by traumatism, senility, arteriosclerosis,
syphilis, brain and nervous diseases, alcoholism,
exogenous toxins, epilepsy, pellagra and somatic diseases
in the causation of mental disorders. In an analysis
of 4,079 cases examined at the Munich Clinic, Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
found the following factors involved:&mdash;1. Physical
diseases, infections and gross brain lesions, 1.3 per
cent; 2. Syphilis and metasyphilis, 10.3 per cent (general
paresis 9.4 per cent); 3. Toxins&mdash;alcohol, morphine, cocaine,
etc., 22.8 per cent (alcoholic psychoses 22.4 per
cent); 4. Traumatic neuroses and prison psychoses, 2.5
per cent; 5. The presenile and senile psychoses, arteriosclerosis,
etc., 5.6 per cent; 6. Dementia praecox, epilepsy,
idiocy and imbecility, 27.2 per cent; 7. Psychopathic and
hysterical states, and manic-depressive insanity, 30.3 per
cent. Conditions existing in our hospitals and clinics
are somewhat different. As the result of a study of over
seventy thousand first admissions to forty-eight hospitals
in sixteen different states we are now in a position to
speak quite definitely as to the frequency of the conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
above referred to as etiological factors. Traumatic
psychoses quite uniformly represent a little less than
one-half of one per cent of the admissions to our institutions.
The senile psychoses constitute approximately
ten per cent and arteriosclerosis five per cent of the total.
General paresis averages about twelve per cent in the
New York hospitals and from seven to ten per cent in the
other states. Cerebral syphilis amounts to a little less
than one per cent of the cases. It should be said that in
the large cities the rate for syphilis is, in some instances
at least, twice as high as that given. Brain tumor, with all
other brain and nervous diseases, only constitutes about
one and one-half per cent of our admissions. Alcoholism,
which has been responsible for as high as ten per cent of
all admissions, from time to time, has been decreasing
gradually during the last five years and in New York in
1920 constituted less than two per cent. Epileptic psychoses
in our state hospitals amount to from one to two
and one-half per cent of the total. As a general rule
pellagra is not a factor of any consequence, amounting to
less than one-half of one per cent of the admissions. In
a few of the southern hospitals large numbers of pellagra
are encountered. The psychoses accompanying somatic
diseases are represented by from three to four per cent
of the whole number. In addition to this, there is still
a considerable number of cases reported from the hospitals
as being caused by psychic trauma of various
kinds. These represent the acute psychoses usually resulting
from mental and emotional upsets but with nothing
which definitely points to constitutional disorders
or hereditary influences.</p>

<p>If we speak of predisposing causes, some reference
should be made to the influence of the physiological landmarks
which are of so much significance in the life of the
individual in more ways than one&mdash;puberty, adolescence,
the climacterium and the senium. A no less noteworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
factor in the female sex is the puerperium. These periods
of life are of tremendous importance in the development
of the psychoses. It is customary to speak of age,
sex, race, civil condition, degree of education, climate,
civilization, etc., as factors in the production of mental
diseases. Not much is to be said on these questions, nor
are they closely related to the subject. On January 1,
1920, there were 232,680 patients in the hospitals for
mental diseases in the United States. Fifty-two per cent
of these were men and forty-eight per cent women. This
represents about the difference that has been shown for
many years. The reduction in alcoholic psychoses may
affect this ultimately. The striking exceptions to this
ratio are Massachusetts and New York, where the number
of women has slightly exceeded the men for a number
of years. The admission rate for men is, however,
slightly higher than that for women in both of those
states. Less than one-half of one per cent of the patients
admitted to the New York hospitals are under
fifteen years of age. In that state approximately five
per cent have been between fifteen and nineteen years old.
In Massachusetts the percentage of persons admitted
who were under twenty years of age has averaged 8.5
quite consistently for some time. The admission rate,
for twenty to twenty-five, twenty-five to thirty, thirty
to thirty-five and thirty-five to forty years of age in Massachusetts
and New York has averaged from ten to
eleven per cent for each of those periods for several
years. From the age of forty to fifty the admission rate
is about 8.5 per cent, and from fifty to sixty between five
and six per cent. Nine per cent of the admissions in
Massachusetts and eight per cent in New York are seventy
years of age or over. The statistics on race, birthplace
and the psychoses of the various races are shown
in detail in the chapter on Immigration. The admission
rate in New York is almost exactly the same for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
married and the unmarried, the former constituting about
thirty-nine per cent and the latter forty. In Massachusetts
the single first admissions amount to about
forty-three per cent and the married approximately forty
per cent. Throughout the country generally the unmarried
slightly predominate. The percentage of widowed
in Massachusetts and New York varies from thirteen to
fourteen per cent. The divorced constitute only about
one per cent of all admissions. As to education, it may
be said that about nine per cent of all first admissions are
illiterate, from fifteen to twenty per cent can read and
write only, about sixty per cent have had a high school
and two per cent a college education. A study of economic
conditions shows that from fifteen to seventeen per
cent are dependent, from sixty to seventy per cent are
rated as marginal, and from eleven to thirteen per cent
as being in comfortable circumstances. In Massachusetts
and New York about eighty-five per cent of the admissions
come from a city environment and from twelve
to fifteen per cent from rural communities. It is interesting
to note that in 1919 eighteen per cent of the admissions
in Massachusetts and New York were reported as
being intemperate in their habits, with over fifty per cent
abstinent.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said that the important etiological
factors in the production of mental disease are
heredity, senility, syphilis, arteriosclerosis, somatic diseases,
mental deficiency, epilepsy, diseases of the brain
and nervous system, alcoholism, drugs, traumatism and
mental stress and shocks of various kinds. It is hardly
necessary to add that our information on this subject
is far from complete.</p>

<span class="st">IMMIGRATION AND MENTAL DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>A history of the development of our western civilization
is very largely a study of the process of assimilation
of the various racial elements representing a new population.
While it must be conceded that we are indebted
to European countries for much that has been contributory
to the welfare and success of American institutions,
it is equally true that the tremendous increase in mental
diseases and defects here is to be attributed in no small
degree to immigration. This constitutes a problem of
social and economic importance which is worthy of serious
consideration. Perhaps no better evidence of this
fact can be offered than a study of such statistics as are
available relating to the thirty-three millions of people
coming to the United States from other countries during
the last century. This would seem to be particularly indicated
at this time, in view of the fact that the conclusion
of the war has brought about the necessity of a new
adjustment of our relations with other countries.</p>

<p>Immigration to the United States has varied greatly
from time to time. It is a well known fact that the
founders of our government were practically all of English,
Dutch, German or Scotch-Irish extraction. Unfortunately
no information of any consequence is available
regarding the aliens entering the country prior to 1820,
when their study was first undertaken by the federal authorities.
As far as can be determined, during the ensuing
ten years about 128,000 were admitted at the
various ports of entry. The history of immigration since
that time has been determined very largely by existing
conditions in other countries. The famines and political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
disturbances in Ireland between 1840 and 1850 were the
occasion of a large influx, concededly of a highly desirable
type. The nature of the tide of incoming immigrants
was changed by the revolutionary troubles in Germany
during the decade following 1848. There was a decrease
for a time during the civil war. This was soon followed
by a considerable increase which continued quite consistently
until the outbreak of the world war. There
would at this time seem to be every reason for thinking
that an unprecedented invasion can be expected during
the next twenty-five years as a result of conditions prevailing
abroad unless some restrictions are imposed. In
1850 and 1860 the number of Irish people in the United
States exceeded the German born. The 1890 census
showed a predominance of the latter race and they have
exceeded the Irish element in the population for some
time. Nearly a million Germans were admitted between
1880 and 1885. Since 1890, however, the number of Irish
and Germans entering have both decreased markedly.
After the Spanish-American war a great increase in immigration
was noted and the rate of admission per year
reached a million in 1905, but the source of supply had
entirely changed.</p>

<p class="p2b">Salmon<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> has shown that in spite of the fact that in
1882 only 12.9 per cent of all incoming aliens admitted
were from those countries, eighty-one per cent of
all immigration from Europe in 1907 came from Austria-Hungary,
Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Poland,
Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, Syria and Turkey.
In 1882, 87.1 per cent of those admitted came from England,
Germany, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland
and Belgium. The races represented by the new tide of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
immigration, according to Salmon, were Slavic, thirty
per cent, Italian, twenty-six per cent, and Hebrew, fifteen
per cent, the remainder being made up of various other
miscellaneous elements. This change is shown by the
fact that the immigration from Austria-Hungary, which
amounted to only 711,926 from 1820 to 1896, increased to
2,303,323 during the first decade of the present century.
Five hundred and thirty-four thousand three hundred
and thirty-six were admitted from Russia between 1820
and 1896 and 1,756,027 between 1900 and 1911. The
Italian immigration, which amounted to 676,826 between
1820 and 1896, increased to 2,228,759 between 1901 and
1911 (Salmon<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>). The numerical status of immigration
by decades is shown in the following table:</p>

<p class="p2ab">A study made by the United States Immigration Commission
some years ago showed that of 68,942 foreign
born males employed in various mining and manufacturing
industries, and who had been in the United States
for five years or more, only 33.3 per cent had obtained
naturalization papers. Of 246,673 of this same class

<p class="p2ab">In 1912 an investigation was made of the foreign
born in the New York state hospitals. As a result of the
census taken, it was found that of 31,624 patients, 13,728,

or 43.4 per cent, were foreign born. Of this number
4,487 had been naturalized and 9,241, or 29.2 per cent of
the total hospital population were aliens. At the Manhattan
State Hospital in New York City, out of a total
of 4,570 patients 2,526 were foreign born and only 708
had been naturalized. The Central Islip State Hospital
at the same time had 4,438 patients. Of this number
2,803 were foreign born and only 891 were naturalized
citizens. Thus, at the Manhattan State Hospital 39.8 per
cent and at the Central Islip State Hospital 43.1 per cent
of the patients were aliens. It was shown that the average
hospital residence of the insane in the state was 9.85
years. Based on the maintenance expenditures for 1912
it was estimated that the cost to New York for caring for
its 9,241 aliens in the state hospitals was $2,579,902.78
per year, and for their entire hospital residence, over
twenty-five million dollars.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Of the first admissions to

The influence which immigration may have had in determining
the relative frequency of various psychoses in our
institutions is an exceedingly interesting question. In
speaking of the susceptibility of certain races to special
types of disease, Salmon<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> says, "This is particularly
true of mental diseases, for if racial characteristics profoundly
affect political, social and religious ideals we
must look for a similar influence upon the individual
makeup which so largely determines trends in mental
disease. All those who are familiar with mental diseases
among the Japanese in California testify to the remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
tendency to suicide in that race, not only in depressed
conditions but in conditions in which suicidal
tendencies, in other races, are not frequent. This is in
accordance with the general attitude of the Japanese toward
self-destruction. The strong tendency to delusional
trends of a persecutory nature in West Indian negroes,
the frequency with which we find hidden sexual complexes
among the Hebrews and the remarkable prevalence of
mutism among Poles, even in psychoses in which mutism
is not a common symptom, are familiar examples of the
influence of racial traits upon mental diseases." As the
result of a special study of this subject Salmon has
reached the following conclusions: "1. The psychoses
more prevalent among Hebrews than in the native stock
are manic depressive psychosis, dementia praecox, the
psychoneuroses, and psychoses associated with constitutional
inferiority. 2. The absence of alcoholic psychoses
among Hebrews is the most striking clinical fact in connection
with immigration. In 1909 there were but 3 patients
with alcoholic psychoses in 448 Hebrews admitted
to all the New York state hospitals. 3. The very high
prevalence of general paresis among Italians bears a
direct relation to the high prevalence of venereal diseases
among Italians in New York.... 4. Italians show a
freedom from alcoholic psychoses second only to Hebrews.
5. Italians exceed the native born in the prevalence
of epileptic psychoses, infective exhaustive psychoses
and dementia praecox.... 7. From the data
available, alcoholic psychoses are found to be more prevalent
among Slavs than among any other races of the new
immigration, but not as prevalent as among the native-born.
8. General paresis is nearly twice as prevalent
among Slavs as in the native-born, but not so prevalent
as among the Italians. Dementia praecox is more prevalent
among the Slavs than among the native-born."</p>

<p class="p2">This shows some very interesting results. It will be
noted that the Hebrews and Italians have the highest
rate for dementia praecox, the percentage shown by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
these races being much higher than any of the others.
The Germans, Italians and Hebrews, in the order mentioned,
have the highest rates for manic-depressive psychoses.
The frequency of alcoholic psychoses as shown
by the Irish is nearly double that of any of the others.
The Slavonic race has the highest rate for general paresis,
followed in close succession by the French and Germans.
The highest rate for senile and arteriosclerotic
psychoses combined is shown by the races of mixed origin,
the next highest by the English, closely followed by the
Irish. The most common psychosis in every instance
is dementia praecox. In the admissions to the institutions
for the criminal insane in New York the highest
percentages are represented by the Irish, Italian and
Hebrew races, as shown in another chapter. During a
period of six years (1912 to 1918) a study of first admissions
to the New York state hospitals shows an incidence
of dementia praecox in the native-born of 75.2
per hundred thousand of the population and in the foreign
born of 161.4. The importance of this is shown
by the fact that over fifty per cent of the entire hospital
population is made up of cases of dementia praecox.</p>

<p>The necessity of some supervision of immigration for
the purpose of preventing the entrance of undesirable
aliens has long been recognized. As early as 1824 the
state of New York tried by legislation to prevent the admission
of the insane and mental defectives. This effort
was a failure, probably owing to the fact that the proposed
enactments would have compelled the companies
responsible for the entrance of undesirable aliens to remove
them if they became a public charge. The introduction
of discordant racial elements from abroad at
one time disturbed the equilibrium of the entire country.
The agitation for the restriction of immigration before
the civil war led to the formation of a political organization
known as the "Native American" or "Know Nothing"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
party, as it was usually called. It at one time had
forty representatives in Congress and nominated a candidate
for President in 1856. These disturbed conditions
led to the consideration of this subject by Congress as
early as 1838 and the Judiciary Committee recommended
legislation prohibiting the entrance of idiots, lunatics and
those suffering from incurable diseases or convicted of
crime. The action of several foreign countries in pardoning
murderers with the provision that they should
emigrate to the United States led to a resolution of protest
by Congress in 1860 and shortly thereafter a statute
intended to encourage immigration was repealed. An
investigation made by the United States Immigration
Commission brought to light the fact that the great influx
of foreigners was largely caused by the agents of the
steamboat companies abroad and that they had "five or
six thousand ticket agents in Galicia alone."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The activities of those opposed to the indiscriminate
entrance of objectionable aliens led to the federal enactment
of August 3, 1882. The Secretary of the Treasury
was charged with the duty of prohibiting the landing
of lunatics, idiots and persons liable to become a public
charge. The provisions for the execution of this law
were not satisfactory and it was amended by an act of
1891. This made it a misdemeanor to bring in any of
the above proscribed classes and imposed a fine of over
one thousand dollars upon anyone guilty of so doing.
Section 11 provided that aliens entering in violation of
this law could be returned at any time within one year
thereafter at the expense of the person or persons, vessel,
transportation company or corporation responsible
for their entry, and further, that those becoming public
charges within one year from causes existing prior to
landing should be considered as having entered in violation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of law. The provisions of this statute were unchanged
until the act of March 3, 1903. This excluded
persons insane within five years previous to landing,
those having had two or more previous attacks at any
time, paupers and all others liable to become a public
charge. Section 17 delegated to the officers of the United
States Public Health Service the duty of determining the
condition of all immigrants. Section 20 provided that
aliens coming to the United States in violation of law, or
who were found to be public charges from causes existing
prior to landing, could be deported at any time within
two years. Section 21 authorized the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor to deport any alien within three years
of entering in violation of the act.</p>

<p>An important step in the legislative restriction of
immigration was the amendment of Feb. 20, 1907. This
made mandatory the exclusion of idiots, imbeciles, the
feebleminded, epileptics, insane, all who had been insane
within five years and persons having had two
or more attacks of insanity at any time, or who were
likely to become a public charge, as well as individuals
not comprehended in the foregoing excluded classes but
found to be suffering from mental or physical defects
of such a nature as to affect their ability to earn a living.
Section 20 provided that an alien entering in violation
of law or becoming a public charge from causes existing
prior to landing should, upon the warrant of the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor, be taken into custody and
deported to the country from whence he came at any
time within three years after the date of his entry into
the United States. The cost of this removal was to be
a charge upon the owners of the vessel or transportation
line immediately responsible. When the mental or
physical condition of the alien was such as to require
personal care or attention, the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor was authorized to employ a suitable person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
for that purpose. This was a great step in advance. There
were, however, some very great difficulties to be overcome.
The force placed at the disposal of the Public Health
Service for the inspection and examination of incoming
immigrants was entirely inadequate and one or two men
were sometimes responsible for the examination of several
thousands aliens in a day. This was, of course, impossible.
The burden of proof in showing that the mental
condition was due to causes existing prior to landing,
furthermore, devolved upon the persons requesting deportation.
It was impossible in many instances to submit
actual proof even where there could be no reasonable
doubt as to the facts. This led to great difficulties and
much dissatisfaction. Another serious objection to the
provisions of this law was the requirement that only
such persons could be deported as were likely to become
a public charge. In many instances such persons
were supported by private funds until they were no
longer deportable, after which they became a burden
upon the state in which they resided.</p>

<p>These conditions were much improved by the action
of the Sixty-fourth Congress in 1917. This definitely
excluded "all idiots, imbeciles, feebleminded persons, epileptics,
insane persons; persons who have had one or
more attacks of insanity at any time previously; persons
of constitutional psychopathic inferiority," etc., or "persons
not comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded
classes who are found to be and are certified by the
examining surgeons as being mentally or physically defective"
or persons likely to become a public charge.
Section 9 provided that it shall be unlawful for any person,
"including any transportation company," to bring
either from a foreign country or any insular possession
of the United States any alien afflicted with idiocy, insanity,
imbecility, feeblemindedness, epilepsy, constitutional
psychopathic inferiority, etc., and subjected to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fine any person or persons so doing. The Secretary of
Labor was also authorized to detail inspectors and matrons
to duty on vessels carrying immigrants, who shall
"report to the immigration authorities in charge at the
port of landing any information of value in determining
the admissibility of such passengers that may have become
known to them during the voyage." It also provided
that a mental examination of all arriving aliens
should be made by medical officers of the United States
Public Health Service who shall certify all mental defects
or diseases observed. "Medical officers of the
United States Public Health Service who have had special
training in the diagnosis of insanity and mental defects
shall be detailed for duty or employed at all ports
of entry designated by the Secretary of Labor." Section
19 provided, that any alien "who within five years
after entry becomes a public charge from causes not
affirmatively shown to have arisen subsequent to landing"
shall, upon warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken
into custody and deported. The act also made provision
for the first time for a literacy test which has been a
subject of discussion for years. These amendments are
of far-reaching importance and will eventually undoubtedly
afford the hospitals considerable relief. The fact
still remains, however, that the individual states are expending
millions of dollars annually for the care and
maintenance of an alien population which should have
been excluded by the federal government. Under these
circumstances it would seem nothing more than fair that
the states should be reimbursed for the cost of carrying
a burden for which they are in no way responsible.</p>

<span class="st">MENTAL DISEASES AND CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="p2">The question of responsibility for criminal acts, once
a legal problem pure and simple, is now recognized as
involving sociological, psychological and psychiatric considerations
of far-reaching importance. This viewpoint,
none too thoroughly established even now, represents the
progress of several centuries, and still lacks adequate
recognition in law. The eloquent protest against the
legal conception of mental diseases written by Isaac
Ray<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> in 1838 sounds like a quotation from a recent medical
journal. "In all civilized communities, ancient or
modern, insanity has been regarded as exempting from
the punishment of crime, and vitiating the civil acts of
those who are affected with it. The only difficulty, or
diversity of opinion, consists in determining who are
really insane, in the meaning of the law, which has been
content with merely laying down some general principles,
and leaving their application to the discretion of the
judicial authorities.... It is to be feared, that the
principles, laid down on this subject by legal authorities,
have received too much of that reverence which is naturally
felt for the opinions and practices of our ancestors;
and that innovations have been too much regarded,
rather as the offspring of new-fangled theories, than of
the steady development of medical science. In their zeal
to uphold the wisdom of the past, from the fancied desecrations
of reformers and theorists, the ministers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
law seem to have forgotten, that, in respect to this subject,
the real dignity and respectability of their profession
is better upheld, by yielding to the improvements of
the times, and thankfully receiving the truth from whatever
quarter it may come, than by turning away with
blind obstinacy from everything that conflicts with long
established maxims and decisions."</p>

<p>A brief reference to the history of the development
of the present legal conceptions of criminal responsibility
will justify the comments made by Ray. The terms
idiocy, lunacy and non compos mentis were all used by
Coke in his "Institutes of the Laws of England" written,
as nearly as can be determined, in 1625. A differentiation
between the significance of the word idiot and
non compos mentis appeared as early as 1325 in the English
statute "De Praerogativa Regis," which delegated
various responsibilities to the crown that are recognized
to this day. Sir Matthew Hale, about 1670, described
a partial and a total insanity, the former not being accepted
as relieving the accused of responsibility for the
commitment of a crime. It is an interesting fact that
we still hear the question of partial insanity seriously discussed.
In 1723 Justice Tracy in a murder trial ruled
that "a prisoner in order to be acquitted on the ground
of insanity must be a man that is totally deprived of his
understanding and memory, and doth not know what he
is doing no more than an infant, than a brute or a wild
beast." As a result of this ruling a man was found guilty
of attempting to murder a neighbor who sent devils and
imps into his house at night for the purpose of disturbing
his sleep. Fortunately the sentence was commuted to
life imprisonment. In 1812 the Attorney General of
England<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> ruled that "a man may be deranged in his
mind&mdash;his intellect may be insufficient for enabling him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to conduct the common affairs of life, such as disposing
of his property, or judging of the claims which his respective
relations have upon him; and if he be so, the
administration of the country will take his affairs into
their management, and appoint to him trustees; but, at
the same time, such a man is not discharged from his responsibility
for criminal acts."</p>

<p>The legal procedure of the present day is based very
largely on the decisions made at the time of the McNaughton
trial in 1843. In this case the Chief Justice,
as quoted by Lord Lyndhurst, addressed the following
words to the jury: "The point which at last will be submitted
to you will be whether or not on the whole of
the evidence you have heard you are satisfied that at
the time the act was committed, for the commission of
which the prisoner stands charged, he had not that competent
use of his understanding as not to know what he
was doing with respect to the act itself&mdash;a wicked and
wrong thing&mdash;whether he knew it was a wicked and a
wrong thing he had done, or that he was not sensible at
the time he committed this act that it was contrary to
the laws of God and man." This case led to a very serious
consideration of the subject in the House of Lords.
As the result of an official request for an opinion, the majority
of the judges of the court, all concurring but one,
expressed the view that "to establish a defense on the
ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at
the time of the committing of the act the accused party
was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease
of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of
the act he was doing; or if he did know it (sic) that he did
not know he was doing what was wrong."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The importance and significance of these decisions,
which one might very readily assume to be obsolete and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
too ancient to be worthy of consideration, will be made
clear by a quotation from the penal code in effect in New
York today. "Sec. 1120 (Penal Law). Incompetency of
idiot or lunatic. An act done by a person who is an idiot,
imbecile, lunatic or insane is not a crime. A person cannot
be tried, sentenced to any punishment or punished
for a crime while he is in a state of idiocy, imbecility,
lunacy or insanity so as to be incapable of understanding
the proceeding or making his defense. A person is not
excused from criminal liability as an idiot, imbecile, lunatic
or insane person except upon proof that, at the time
of committing the alleged insane act, he was laboring
under such a defect of reason as 1, not to know the nature
and quality of the act he was doing; or 2, not to know
that the act was wrong." It will, I think, be conceded
that we have, at least, not lost ground in any way since
1843.</p>

<p>No less interesting is the legal definition of insanity
in Massachusetts: "The words 'insane person' and
'lunatic' shall include every idiot, non compos, lunatic
and insane and distracted person." (Chapter 4, Sec. 7,
General Laws of Massachusetts.) In New York the
terms lunatic and lunacy include every kind of unsoundness
of mind except idiocy. (Chapter 22, Sec. 28, Consolidated
Laws.) This would presumably include psychopathic
personality and imbecility.</p>

<p>Numerous court decisions have had a material bearing
on the subject of responsibility. It has been held in
New York that partial or incipient insanity is not a sufficient
defense if there is still an ability to form a correct
perception of the legal quality of the act and to know
that it was wrong. (People vs. Taylor, 138 N. Y. 398, 407
(1893)). A weak or disordered mind is not excused from
the consequences of crime. (People vs. Burgess, 153
N. Y. 561, 569 (1897)), etc. Generally speaking, the legal
methods of determining criminal responsibility do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
vary to any material extent with the different states. It
is obvious that the responsibility for crime as defined
by the courts is far from harmonizing with the conception
of competency entertained by the medical profession.
To the psychiatrist, if the criminal act is the result of the
mental condition it constitutes a symptom of the disease
process. It is readily apparent from even a very brief
reference to the statutes that a person concededly suffering
from paranoia, general paresis, dementia praecox
or any other well-defined psychosis is still criminally
liable for his insane acts within certain limitations.
From a medical point of view the existence of a psychosis,
if associated with a consequent judgment defect, emotional
instability, disturbance of volition, intellectual deterioration,
delusional and particularly persecutory control,
hallucinatory trends, ideas of reference, etc., is of
itself quite sufficient to explain criminal acts in the insane.
This, however, as has been shown, is not the legal
point of view. The accused is fully responsible unless it
can be shown that he is suffering from such a defect of
reason as not to appreciate the quality or nature of his
act or that the act is wrong. There is no other legal
standard. It is a well-known fact that many persons
adjudged insane by the courts and committed to our
institutions are fully competent to discriminate between
right and wrong from an ethical point of view, although
legally held to be incompetent and unsafe to be at large.
These divergent viewpoints presumably are due to the
fact that the law moves only with a degree of dignity
which theoretically guarantees absolute security in avoiding
any possible sources of error. It nevertheless is responsible
for many miscarriages of justice.</p>

<p>Efforts to remedy this state of affairs have been made
repeatedly by the medical profession. The American
Psychiatric Association has devoted a great deal of time
and attention to this subject, unfortunately without any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
very concrete results. The last official action taken was
the unanimous approval of the following <span class="no-break">resolutions:&mdash;</span>
<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>"Resolved: 1. That the proved rarity of wrong acquittals
on the ground of insanity is the strongest evidence
that the abuse of the insanity plea in criminal
cases has been unwarrantably exaggerated.</p>

<p>"2. That the insanity plea is not by any means raised
as often as it should be, to prevent the frequent miscarriage
of justice arising from the conviction and imprisonment
of insane persons whose true mental condition
has not been recognized.</p>

<p>"3. That the abuses which have crept into the method
of presenting medical expert testimony have been largely
the result of established legal tests and procedures, although
their correction does not require radical change
in the laws.</p>

<p>"4. That inaccessibility of the evidence on both sides
of the case is the chief cause of defective medical testimony.</p>

<p>"5. That whenever possible the medical witness
should not testify unless he has had an opportunity to
make both a mental and a physical examination of the
person in whose behalf the plea of insanity is raised.</p>

<p>"6. That we consider the hypothetical question as
ordinarily presented to be unscientific, misleading and
dangerous to medical repute and that the evidence on
both sides should always be included in its presentation
to medical witnesses.</p>

<p>"7. That in all criminal cases absolutely equal rights
should be accorded the medical witnesses for both the
prosecution and the defence for the examination of the
person alleged to be insane.</p>

<p>"8. That in our judgment the judiciary should by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
legal enactment be allowed more latitude in enlightening
the jury and enabling it to comprehend the nature and
meaning of the medical testimony laid before it.</p>

<p>"9. That we recommend as advisable the adoption
wherever possible of the so-called Leed's method of preliminary
consultation by medical witnesses on both sides
of the case as to its status.</p>

<p>"10. That we advocate a freer use of appointments
of commissions by the court.</p>

<p>"11. That a period of hospital observation of all
persons committing crimes in whose defence the plea
of insanity has been raised is by far the best method yet
devised for securing impartial and accurate opinions,
silencing popular clamor, avoiding prolonged and sensational
trials and saving expense to the State; also that we
advocate the enactment in every State of laws similar
to those of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts,
providing that such persons may be committed
by the court to a State hospital for the insane there to
remain for such time as the court may direct pending
the determination of their insanity.</p>

<p>"12. That it is the sense of the Association that it
is subversive of the dignity of the medical profession for
any of its members to occupy the position of medical
advisory counsel in open court and at the same time
to act as expert witness in a medico-legal case.</p>

<p>"13. That we regard the acceptance by a physician
of a fee that is contingent upon the result of a medico-legal
case as not in accordance with medical ethics and
derogatory to the good repute of the profession, and
advocate the regulation of the practice by legislation.</p>

<p>"14. That we are in favor of any legislation that will
secure a definite standard of qualification for medical
men giving expert testimony."</p>

<p>An equal amount of consideration has been given to
this important question from time to time by the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology. At a
recent meeting of that organization the following recommendations
were submitted by a committee:</p>

<p>"1. That in all cases of felony or misdemeanor punishable
by a prison sentence the question of responsibility
be not submitted to the jury, which will thus be
called upon to determine only that the offense was committed
by the defendant.</p>

<p>"2. That the disposition and treatment (including
punishment) of all such misdemeanants and felons, i.e.,
the sentence imposed, be based upon a study of the individual
offender by properly qualified and impartial
experts cooperating with the courts.</p>

<p>"3. That provisions be made permitting the transfer
of such misdemeanants and felons at any time after conviction
from one institution to another affording a different
kind of treatment upon the presentation of evidence
of the needs for such action satisfactory to the court
which passed sentence.</p>

<p>"4. That no maximum term be set to any sentence.</p>

<p>"5. That no parole or probation be granted without
suitable psychiatric examination.</p>

<p>"6. That in considering applications for pardons and
commutation careful attention be given to reports of
qualified experts showing the applicant's mental age
and mental stability and that in drafting statutes determining
or defining juvenile delinquency, mental age and
mental stability, within reasonable limits, be regarded
as of importance with the calendar age of the delinquent.</p>

<p>"In view of the foregoing and as an initial step
towards the ends stated, the committee submits the following
resolution and urges its immediate adoption:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the several states be urged to make
provision for the psychiatric examination, under conditions
permitting prolonged observation when necessary,
of all persons convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
other offense by properly qualified experts appointed
to assist the court in reaching a decision as to the proper
disposition and treatment of the offender."</p>

<p>The courts, the medical profession and the public have
shown indications of a decided dissatisfaction with existing
methods of determining criminal responsibility.
This will certainly continue as long as the sole test of
competency is the power of the accused to discriminate
between a knowledge of right and wrong at the time when
the act is committed. The conditions which lead to crime
have been made the subject of scientific study by many.
One of the early investigators in this field was Morel,
who saw in the criminal a personification "of the various
degenerations of the species." Much has been said of
"moral insanity," a condition referred to by Abercromby
as one "in which all the upright sentiments are eliminated
while the intelligence presents no disorders." Lombroso
advanced the theory that criminality is a form of atavism&mdash;a
reversion of man to the primitive and savage type
represented by his early ancestors. This theory was
based on a careful study of the anatomical, physiological
and psychological characteristics of primitive man. His
classification included the occasional, the emotional, the
born criminal, the moral insane, and the masked epileptic.
Marro offered an anatomical basis for the degenerative
theory in the form of nutritional defects in the central
nervous system. Ferri distinguished between criminal
lunatics and emotional criminals and held crime to be
"a phenomenon of complex origin and the result of biological,
physical and social conditions." "Habitual
criminals," he says, "are the victims of a clear, evident
and common mental alienation which causes the criminal
activity," while the occasional offenders are to be explained
by "the impulse of opportunities more than the
innate tendency that determines the crime." The emotional
criminal, according to Ferri, is a sane and moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
individual overcome by momentary emotional paroxysms
referred to as a "psychologic storm." Garofalo, on the
other hand, looked upon crime as "an offense against the
fundamental altruistic sentiments of pity and probity."
From his point of view a criminal act was an indication
of the loss of a proper sense of appreciation of the life
or property of another&mdash;a moral anomaly. The Italian
school of criminology was responsible also for the theory
that criminal acts are only the expression of epileptic
symptoms. Sociological workers have attributed crime
to influences which overcome the natural resistance of the
individual, a variation from which is merely an inability
of the person to conform to the laws of environment.
Max Nordau sees in human failings only an abnormality
which he describes as "human parasitism." Others look
upon crime as the natural product of a modern social
and economic system. Colajanni ascribes alcoholism,
vagrancy and prostitution to poverty, but crime, he says,
is "due to necessity and to the degree and kind of education
received." In the light of our present knowledge
the conclusion would appear to be warranted that crime
is the result of constitutional defects in the form of hereditary
tendencies and arrested mental development, educational
defects, a deterioration of habits as shown by
alcoholism, etc., accidental influences such as environment
and poverty, pathological conditions, including epilepsy
and insanity, and precipitating factors in the form
of emotional disturbances.</p>

<p>Criminality, alcoholism, poverty, prostitution and
mental deficiency are closely correlated. A special committee
appointed by the New York State Prison Commission
has made an exceedingly interesting report<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> on
the relation existing between mental disease and crime.
Their investigation shows that 21.8 per cent of 608 cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
at Sing Sing, thirty-five per cent of 459 men at Auburn,
twenty-two per cent of three hundred men at the Massachusetts
State Prison, twenty-eight per cent of forty-nine
women at Joliet, twenty-five per cent of seventy-six
women at Auburn, twenty-three per cent of one hundred
cases at the Indiana State Prison and thirty per cent of
150 examined at San Quentin were found to be mentally
defective. An average of 27.5 per cent has been found
in the prison population as a whole. Thirty-one and four-tenths
per cent of the inmates of reformatories, training
schools, workhouses and penitentiaries were found to
be feebleminded. From twenty-seven to twenty-nine per
cent of the inmates of penal and correctional institutions
of the country were said to be defective. About thirty
per cent of the population of the penal institutions for
women in New York were found to be feebleminded. A
study of 502 selected cases at the Psychopathic Laboratory
of the Police Department of New York City in 1917
showed that fifty-eight per cent were suffering from
either nervous or mental abnormalities. Of one thousand
offenders examined by the medical service of the
Boston Municipal Court twenty-three per cent were feebleminded,
10.4 per cent, psychopathic, 3.17 per cent,
epileptic and nine per cent, mentally diseased and deteriorated;
45.6 per cent in all showed abnormal mental conditions.
It has been shown that one of the most important
causes of recidivism is mental deficiency. The importance
of this observation may be illustrated by the
fact that of 133,047 persons admitted to the penal and
correctional institutions of New York state sixty per
cent had served previous terms. Of 25,820 persons received
at institutions in Massachusetts during one year,
57.4 per cent were recidivits. Justice Roads is responsible
for the statement that of 180,000 convictions in England
in one year more than ten thousand represented
persons convicted upwards of twenty times previously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The mental condition of the cases committed to the
Matteawan State Hospital is of great importance in a
consideration of the relation of crime to the psychoses.
Of 2,595 cases admitted between 1875 and 1907 heredity
or congenital defects were shown as etiological factors
in eight per cent of the total number. Of 793 admissions
in which more definite and reliable information was available,
hereditary factors were noted in either the paternal
or maternal branches of the family or both in thirty-five
per cent of the cases. In addition to this, heredity was
found in collateral branches in sixteen per cent. Heredity
of some kind was thus shown in 51.3 per cent of the
whole number studied. Of 3,247 admissions, 46.9 per
cent were noted as being intemperate in their habits. An
analysis of 576 unconvicted cases in 1912<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> showed that
41.4 per cent were diagnosed as dementia praecox, 21.1
per cent as alcoholic psychoses, 6.9 per cent as paranoid
conditions, 4.1 per cent as epileptic psychoses, 7.1 per
cent as imbecility with excitements, 2.9 per cent as manic-depressive
psychoses, 2.4 per cent as general paresis, 3.1
per cent as undifferentiated depressions, 6.7 per cent
as constitutional inferiority and 2.2 per cent as not insane.
An analysis of 925 cases committed as insane and
charged with criminal offenses attributable to their mental
condition shows the more common crimes as follows:&mdash;assault
(all forms), 26.2 per cent, burglary, 7.8, grand
larceny, 8.2, petit larceny, 1, manslaughter, 1.4, murder,
18.9, homicide (total), 22.4, rape, 3.2, and vagrancy, 4.2
per cent.</p>

<p>Nolan<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
has made an analysis of 646 first admissions
to Matteawan during a period of six years (1912 to
1918). Forty-eight per cent of these were found to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
been born in foreign countries. A striking observation
was the large proportion of male cases born in Italy
(10.8 per cent) and the female cases born in Ireland (11.7
per cent). Of the various races represented it was noted
that the African, which was only responsible for 3.9
per cent of the admissions to civil hospitals, constituted
7.4 per cent of the Matteawan admissions. The races
having the largest representation were the Irish (18.7
per cent), the Italian (12.4 per cent) and the Hebrew
(10.8 per cent). The mixed races constituted 11.3 per cent
of the admissions as compared with twenty-three per cent
of the cases reported from civil institutions. Among the
male cases 11.4 per cent were charged with disorderly
conduct and 26.47 per cent with vagrancy. Of the women,
eighteen per cent were charged with disorderly conduct,
16.4 with public intoxication and 39.8 per cent with vagrancy
and prostitution. These three groups represent
74.2 per cent of all of the female cases admitted. Of the
646 criminal acts causing commitment, 34.1 per cent were
classified from a legal point of view as felonies and 65.9
per cent as misdemeanors. Only 5.3 per cent were
charged with murder, manslaughter, etc. Of the various
psychoses represented by these cases 26.9 per cent were
diagnosed as dementia praecox, seventeen per cent as
alcoholic psychoses, 14.7 per cent as constitutional psychopathic
inferiority, 7.3 as mental deficiency, 8.3 as
manic-depressive psychoses, 11.3 as general paresis, 3.6
as senile psychoses, 2.0 as paranoia or paranoid conditions,
2.2 as epileptic psychoses, and 1.4 per cent as not
insane. The alcoholic, constitutionally inferior and mentally
defective group constituted thirty-eight per cent
of the total. Of the 165 cases diagnosed as dementia
praecox it is interesting to note that eleven were charged
with homicide, ten with assault in the first degree, fifteen
with burglary, thirteen with petit larceny, fourteen with
disorderly conduct, and sixty-six with vagrancy or prostitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Of the seventy-four cases of general paresis
thirteen were charged with petit larceny, eleven with disorderly
conduct, and twenty-nine with vagrancy or prostitution.
The homicides and assaults were committed
principally by the alcoholic, dementia praecox, constitutionally
inferior and the defective cases. The burglaries
and larcenies were committed largely by patients diagnosed
as suffering from general paresis, dementia praecox
and constitutional psychopathic inferiority.</p>

<p>The type of cases received at an institution exclusively
for insane convicts is naturally quite different, as
shown by the admissions to the Dannemora State Hospital
in New York. Of 185 admissions covering a period
of three years the principal psychoses represented were
dementia praecox, forty-one per cent, constitutional psychopathic
inferiority, nineteen per cent, manic-depressive
psychoses, eight, mental deficiency, nine, alcoholic psychoses,
five, paranoid conditions, four per cent, etc.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the defective criminal
classes are not suitable cases for either penal institutions
or hospitals for the insane. They are unable to adapt
themselves to prison discipline or hospital routine and
prefer to associate only with persons of their own kind
who are given to foolish boasting of their crimes as their
least harmful diversion. They are entirely unappreciative
of any efforts made on their behalf to improve their
condition or fit them in any way for the requirements of
society. They are strongly inclined to unprovoked
cruelty to others. Often they manifest an apparent interest
in religious services, thinking it may lead to some
preferment, but not for any moral reason. They are
notoriously untruthful, unreliable and exhibit a low cunning
which often deceives those not familiar with handling
individuals of that type. Curiously enough they are
exceedingly critical of others and quick to notice their
shortcomings. Sexual perversions and immoral conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
are only too common. Prostitution, as has already been
shown, is one of the most common failings of the female
delinquent. An interesting but superficial knowledge of
legal matters is noted very frequently and paraded with
a remarkable degree of egotism which is difficult to
understand. It is comparatively an infrequent occurrence
for a prisoner to admit that he is guilty of the crime of
which he has already been convicted by a court. Only a
few years since, a prisoner at Sing Sing wrote the
Governor of New York suggesting that his release was
indicated as a moral procedure for the good of the institution,
as he was convinced from information obtained
from others that he was the only guilty man in the establishment.
The habitual criminal takes little, if any, interest
in his own relatives or family except when he is in
confinement, and feels no home ties. There is a curious
lack of appreciation for the gravity of his own offense
and he always complains of a "frame up" and asserts
that he has not had a square deal. Homicides even are
always explained in an attempt to show that they were
justifiable or unavoidable. The most vicious of assaults
are often committed on their fellow prisoners without any
provocation of consequence. Experience shows that as
a rule they are incapable of any sustained effort and
accomplish little or nothing when left to themselves.
Tendencies to crime show not only a marked suggestibility
but a degree of impulsiveness and a lack of self control
which is highly significant.</p>

<p>Another type of institution for this special group of
cases is strongly indicated. They should be held under
an indeterminate sentence and in some instances committed
for life. As a result of hereditary defects, arrested
mental development, ignorance and vicious tendencies
this class furnishes the prisons with our most dangerous
criminals. They should receive separate care, with an
opportunity for a special education adapted to their individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
needs. The defective classes have for centuries
been held criminally responsible and have filled our prisons
with incorrigibles and recidivists. Modern civilization
should place at our disposal some means for
remedying this situation other than mere punishment for
the possession of an intellectual endowment for which
these individuals are in no way responsible. The ends
of justice can be served and the protection of the public
assured at the same time by a form of medical treatment
for the defective delinquent which will look forward to
his ultimate restoration to society rather than a form of
punishment which accomplishes nothing.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHIATRY OF THE WAR</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The psychiatry of the late war is of unusual interest
from various points of view. Never before have mental
diseases or defects been looked upon as military problems
worthy of any special attention either in times of war or
peace. It is true that the United States government has
maintained a hospital for the treatment of such conditions
at Washington for many years, and medical officers from
the army and navy have been sent to that institution for
instruction, from time to time. No adequate provision
has been made, however, in previous wars for the special
care or observation of the psychoses or neuroses, nor has
any great consideration been given to a determination of
the mental status of recruits. It is, of course, equally
true that modern military methods have brought about
different conditions and given rise to new problems.
In 1917 and 1918 definite psychiatric organizations were
established by the United States army for the first time.
The services of specialists in mental diseases were utilized
extensively and they were ultimately assigned to
practically all of the large hospitals. Division consultants
were soon found necessary and the active cooperation
of practically every psychiatrist available in the
country was required before the armistice was declared.</p>

<p>This was directly due to the fact that for the first
time in history one of the most important problems, with
which the military authorities had to deal, was the question
of mental diseases and defects. For purposes of
comparison and the intelligent consideration of this important
subject, the incidence of mental diseases in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
army in the past is of considerable interest. The rate
in enlisted men, as shown by the Surgeon General's reports,
varied from 1.08 per thousand in 1898 to 1.73 in
1911, and was 2.72 in 1900, the only year in which it went
above two. In 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1915, when defective
mental development, constitutional psychopathic states,
hypochondriasis and nostalgia were included in the reports
the rates per thousand were respectively 3.45, 3.44,
4.18 and 3.82. The frequency of psychoses was higher in
the men serving in the Philippines&mdash;2.07 in 1898, 2.79 in
1900, 1.45 in 1905 and 2.01 in 1911.</p>

<p>The ratio of mental diseases in the American and English
armies has been higher for many years than in the
French, Italian, Russian and German forces. Universal
military service is supposed to have been the factor producing
this difference, the larger establishments naturally
more nearly representing the normal insanity rate of
the country. From May 1, 1861, to June 30, 1866, in
other words, during the civil war period, there were
198,849 discharges for disability from the United States
army.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Of this number 819 men were discharged on account
of insanity, 3,872 for epilepsy and 2,838 for various
forms of "paralysis." Based on the mean annual
strength of the army, this represented a rate of .34 per
thousand for insanity, 1.6 for epilepsy and 1.17 for paralysis.
Based on the total number of discharges alone, it
represented a rate of 6.0 per thousand for insanity, 20.8
for paralysis, and 28.3 for epilepsy or a rate for the three
combined of 55.1 per thousand. These statistics are for
white soldiers only. The rate for colored troops, based
on the total discharges, was seven per thousand for insanity,
14.3 for paralysis and thirty-six for epilepsy. No
information whatever is available as to what the term
paralysis includes in these reports. The rate per thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in the United States army, as has been shown, increased
from approximately one in 1898 to three in 1901,
during the Spanish war, Philippine insurrection, etc., and
dropped back to one again in 1903. Weygandt,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> who
made a study of war neuroses and psychoses in 1904,
gives the insanity rate per thousand of the German army
during the Franco-Prussian war as .54, the American
troops during the Spanish war as 2.7, the British army
during the Boer war as 2.6, the Russian army during
the Japanese war as 2.0, and the Bulgarian troops during
the Balkan campaign .33. The German expeditionary
corps engaged in Southwestern Africa reported 4.95 per
thousand and a rate of 8.28 including epilepsy and hysteria.</p>

<p>The first attempt ever made to provide special care
for mental diseases in the field was during the Russo-Japanese
war. A hospital set aside for this purpose by
the Russian army at Harbin treated between fifteen
hundred and two thousand men in 1905 and 1906. It has,
however, never been claimed that all of the mental cases
reached that place. Of 1,310 admissions the following
conditions were represented<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>:&mdash;epileptic psychoses,
22.5 per cent; alcoholic forms, 19.5 per cent; dementia
praecox, ten per cent; confused states, nine per cent; hysterical
psychoses, 7.7 per cent; general paresis, 5.6 per
cent; toxic conditions, 4.8 per cent; manic-depressive psychoses,
four per cent; degenerative types, 3.5 per cent;
traumatic psychoses, 3.2 per cent; and organic brain diseases,
2.9 per cent. It is interesting to note that Steida,
who analyzed the statistics of the Russo-Japanese war in
1906, reached the conclusion that a psychic trauma alone
was not a sufficient cause for the development of a neurosis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
He attached an equal importance to prolonged physical
exertion, deprivation, loss of sleep, hunger and
thirst, etc. The most common disturbances following
battles were found to be hysterical excitements and confused
states.</p>

<p>As soon as the examination of men for military service
was undertaken in this country in 1917 it became
apparent that one of the most frequent causes of rejection
was either mental disease or deficiency. The second
report of the Provost Marshal General to the Secretary
of War in 1919<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> showed that of all rejections during the
first year of mobilization, twenty-two per cent were due
to physical defects which would interfere with duty (defects
in bones, and joints, flat foot, hernia, etc.), fifteen
per cent were on account of imperfections of the sense
organs, thirteen per cent were for defects in the cardiovascular
system and about twelve per cent were due to
nervous or mental diseases. The inspection at camps
following the physical examination of the first million
men mobilized resulted in a rejection of nine per cent
on account of nervous or mental diseases. Of all causes
for rejections from the army up to February 1, 1919, according
to Bailey,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> mental and nervous diseases ranked
fourth numerically. The "neuropsychiatric" causes
were:&mdash;psychoses, eleven per cent; neuroses, fifteen per
cent; epilepsy, nine per cent; organic nervous diseases
or injuries, eighteen per cent; mental defects, thirty-two
per cent, and constitutional psychopathic states, nine per
cent; a total of 67,417 cases.</p>

<p>In the organization of our military forces in 1917,
when this country entered the war, every effort was made
to take advantage of the experience of others. Of the
men returned to Canada from European battlefields on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
account of disability, the nervous and mental cases contributed
ten per cent of the total at that time, as was
shown by Farrar.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> These were distributed as follows:&mdash;neurotic
reactions, fifty-eight per cent; mental disease
and defect, sixteen per cent; head injuries, fourteen per
cent; epilepsy and epileptoid conditions, eight per cent;
and organic diseases of the central nervous system, four
per cent. The first group mentioned consisted of neuroses
in general and included the so-called cases of "shell
shock," which brings us to one of the most interesting
problems of the war. Dean A. Worcester, in a recent letter
to the editor of <i>Science</i>, has raised the question as
to whether this is a new disease. He calls attention to
the following reference by Herodotus to the Battle of
Marathon which occurred in the year 490 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>:&mdash;"The
following prodigy occurred there: An Athenian, Epizelius,
son of Capliagoras, while fighting in the medley, and
behaving valiantly, was deprived of sight, though
wounded in no part of his body, nor struck from a distance;
and he continued to be blind from that time for
the remainder of his life. I have heard that he used to
give the following account of his loss. He thought that
a large, heavy armed man stood before him, whose beard
shaded the whole of his shield; that this specter passed
by him, and killed the man that stood by his side. Such
is the account I have been informed Epizelius used to
give."</p>

<p>The nature and cause of shell shock has been the
subject of much controversy. In 1875 Ericksen called
attention to the effect of intense emotional shock on the
nervous system. This he explained as "dependent on
molecular changes in the cord itself." Oppenheim's
monograph in 1899 was responsible for the general use
of the term "traumatic neurosis." His conception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
these conditions was not accepted by Charcot, who at
the time insisted that they belonged to the domain of
hysteria, and were due solely to psychic traumas. Oppenheim's<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
observation of cases during the first year
of the war confirmed his previous views. He expressed
the opinion in 1915 that "in absolutely healthy and mentally
normal individuals, without any trace of hereditary
taint, war trauma may cause psychoses or neuroses.
The causal injury may be of an objective, psychic or
mixed nature. Violent detonations illustrate the mixed
type. Their effect upon the nerve of hearing is certainly
physical, but the psychic effect&mdash;terror&mdash;is also an
important element in the resulting condition. The enormous
air pressure exerted by the close passage of these
missiles is another influential factor. An element that
tends to complicate etiology is the frequent long duration
of the exciting causes (prolonged and continuous
artillery fire, a series of injuries received at brief intervals,
exhaustion from various causes, lack of sleep, insufficient
nourishment, extreme heat or cold, etc.)." He
admits that the symptoms indicate a combination of neurasthenic
and hysterical complexes which may be explained
on a psychogenic basis, but maintains that the war has
demonstrated them to be of a different nature. An external
shock causes "a functional disturbance of the delicate
mechanism of the psychic centers shown in 1, faulty
distribution of motor impulses, 2, hypo-innervation, 3,
hyper-innervation, causing tremors, tonic and clonic
spasms, etc., instead of single muscle actions." He admits
that a hysterical temperament may be an important
factor. Max Nonne<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in 1915 called attention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the fact that conditions combining symptoms of hysteria,
neurasthenia and hypochondriasis plus vasomotor
changes may occur without any history of injury and
should not be called traumatic neuroses for that reason.
He felt that the sudden recoveries occurring so frequently
strongly discredited any theories suggesting an
anatomical basis. He expressed the opinion that the most
common cause was the explosion of hand grenades and
that the main factor involved was an emotional disturbance.
Binswanger<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> was of the opinion that mechanical
injuries to the nervous system were responsible for the
clinical pictures in war hysterias. He found that in a
few cases only was there a history of predisposition, and
maintained that in pre-war conditions hysteria was the
result of a combination of psychic traumas with physical
disturbances. Exciting causes were "over-exertion, irregular
and insufficient nutrition, loss of sleep and high
mental tension." He concludes that "The theory of a
psychic mechanism as the origin of these motor and sensory
symptoms is not demonstrable." "War neurology
has demonstrated that emotional shock, in conjunction
with other injuries, may cause a symptom complex identical
in all its details with the well known clinical picture
of hysteria." Wolfsohn,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> from a study of one hundred
psychoneuroses and one hundred cases of physical
injury received on the firing line, reached the conclusion
that war neuroses are very rarely associated with external
wounds. The vast majority of cases studied had
a neuropathic or psychopathic taint, as shown in the
family history in fourteen per cent of the total. A previous
neuropathic constitution in the patient was found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
seventy-two per cent. "A gradual psychic shock from
long-continued fear, together with the sudden change
from quiet, peaceful environment to the extraordinary
stress and strain of trench fighting, is the chief predisposing
cause of war psychoneurosis in soldiers with
neuropathic predisposition.... Wounded soldiers do
not suffer from war neuroses except in rare instances."</p>

<p>When the United States entered the war, Major, afterwards
Colonel, Thomas W. Salmon<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of the United
States army made an exhaustive study of "The Care and
Treatment of Mental Diseases and War Neuroses
("Shell Shock") in the British Army." At that time
one-seventh of all discharges for disability from the British
forces were due to mental and nervous disorders. As
a matter of fact, they accounted for one-third of all
discharges for actual diseases (eliminating wounds).
England with the advantage of three years of experience
had presumably completed her organization to its
highest efficiency. One and one-tenth per cent of the
cases in the military hospitals were suffering from mental
diseases. The percentage represented by the expeditionary
forces was 1.3. About six thousand "shell
shock" cases were being admitted annually to the English
hospitals. Col. Salmon estimated the admission rate
at two per thousand in the troops at home and four
per thousand in the expeditionary forces. The civilian
rate during the same period was about one to one thousand
of the population. The confusion which existed
early in the war was shown by the fact that ten per cent
of the cases sent to the Red Cross Military Hospital at
Maghull as war neuroses turned out to be insane and
twenty per cent of those admitted as mental cases at the
Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley were subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
found to be suffering from neuroses. The first conclusion
reached by Col. Salmon was that "contrary to popular
belief and to some medical reports published early
in the war, no new clinical types of mental disease have
been seen in soldiers. There are no war psychoses."
He found that of the cases being admitted to the hospitals
for mental diseases about eighteen per cent were mental
defectives, two per cent syphilitic psychoses, twenty
per cent manic-depressive insanity, fourteen per cent
dementia praecox, and seven per cent epilepsy. Statistics
at that time were not available on purely psychopathic
conditions, owing to the classification used.</p>

<p>In discussing the etiology of shell shock Col. Salmon
divides those conditions into four groups&mdash;1. Cases in
which death is caused by exploding shells or mines without
external signs of injury; 2. Those in which severe
neurological symptoms follow burial or concussion by
explosions, with characteristic syndromes suggesting the
operation of mechanical factors; 3. Cases in which there
may or may not be damage to the central nervous system,
but showing neuroses similar to those of civil life&mdash;"In
this group of cases, in which there is possibility but
no proof of damage to the central nervous system, the
symptoms present which might be attributable to such
damage are quite overshadowed by those characteristic
of the neuroses;" and 4. Cases in which even the slightest
damage to the central nervous system from the direct
effect of explosions is exceedingly improbable. He also
found that hundreds of men who have not been exposed
to battle conditions at all develop symptoms almost identical
with those described as "shell shock," many occurring
in the non-expeditionary forces. The psychogenic
factors involved are very well summarized by Col. Salmon
in the following words:&mdash;"The psychological basis
of the war neuroses (like that of the neuroses in civil
life) is an elaboration, with endless variations, of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
central theme: escape from an intolerable situation in
real life to one made tolerable by the neurosis. The conditions
which may make intolerable the situation in
which a soldier finds himself hardly need stating. Not
only fear, which exists at some time in nearly all soldiers
and in many is constantly present, but horror, revulsion
against the ghastly duties which must be sometimes performed,
intense longing for home, particularly in married
men, emotional situations resulting from the interplay
of personal conflicts and military conditions, all
play their part in making an escape of some sort mandatory.
Death provides a means which cannot be sought
consciously. Flight or desertion is rendered impossible
by ideals of duty, patriotism and honor, by the reactions
acquired by training or imposed by discipline and by herd
reactions. Malingering is a military crime and is not at
the disposal of those governed by higher ethical conceptions.
Nevertheless, the conflict between a simple and
direct expression in flight of the instinct of self-preservation
and such factors demands some sort of compromise.
Wounds solve the problem most happily for many men
and the mild exhilaration so often seen among the
wounded has a sound psychological basis. Others with
a sufficient adaptability find a means of adjustment. The
neurosis provides a means of escape so convenient that
the real source of wonder is not that it should play such
an important part in military life but that so many men
should find a satisfactory adjustment without its intervention.
The constitutionally neurotic, having most readily
at their disposal the mechanism of functional nervous
diseases, employ it most frequently. They constitute,
therefore, a large proportion of all cases but a very
striking fact in the present war is the number of men of
apparently normal make-up who develop war neuroses in
the face of the unprecedentedly terrible conditions to
which they are exposed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The symptomatology has been briefly summarized by
Col. Salmon in a way which cannot be improved upon:&mdash;"Most
of them can be summed up in the statement that
the soldier loses a function that either is necessary to
continued military service or prevents his successful
adaptation to war. The symptoms are found in widely
separated fields. Disturbances of psychic functions include
delirium, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, terrifying
battle dreams, anxiety states. The disturbances of
involuntary functions include functional heart disorders,
low blood pressure, vomiting and diarrhea, enuresis,
retention or polyuria, dyspnoea, sweating. Disturbances
of voluntary muscular functions include paralyses, tics,
tremors, gait disturbances, contractures and convulsive
movements. Special senses may be affected producing
pains and anesthesias, mutism, deafness, hyperacusis,
blindness and disorders of speech. It is highly significant
that, in this unprecedented prevalence of functional
nervous diseases among soldiers, no symptoms unfamiliar
to those who see the neuroses in civil life present themselves."</p>

<p>An analysis of the 170,000 cases discharged for disability
in England showed that twenty per cent were due
to war neuroses. In his second Lettsomian lecture
Mott<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> called attention to the interesting similarity between
shell shock following concussion and burial, and
the symptoms resulting from an acute carbon monoxide
poisoning. This was, of course, a very possible complication
in trench warfare. The headache, ringing in the
ears, blurred and indistinct vision, hallucinations of
sight, or actual blindness, giddiness, yawning, weariness,
vomiting, cold sensations, palpitation, sense of oppression
on the chest, etc., so common in gas poisoning are often
followed, when consciousness is regained, by confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and loss of memory, with retrograde amnesia. Tremors
and loss of speech are also frequently noted. Mott
reached the conclusion that shell shock, in some cases at
least, was due to gas poisoning. In his third Lettsomian
lecture he discusses the symptomatology of shell shock.
In some instances there was a partial loss of consciousness,
characterized by dazed states somewhat similar to
those of epilepsy. Under speech defects he includes
mutism, aphonia, stammering, stuttering and verbal
repetition. Headache in the occipital region was found
to be a very common symptom. Vasomotor conditions
were palpitation, breathlessness, pericardial pain, rapid
weak pulse, low blood pressure, cold extremities, low
temperature, etc. Anesthesia and hyperesthesia or loss
of pain sense also occurred, and deafness was often observed.
Smoky vision, photophobia and functional blindness
were frequent eye symptoms. Tremors, tics, choreiform
movements, functional paralysis and gait disturbances
are also mentioned by Mott. In the Chadwick lecture
he later called attention to the presence of insomnia
and terrifying dreams in practically all cases of true shell
shock.</p>

<p>In 1917 Mott<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> reported the examination of the
brains from two cases of pure shell shock. They showed a
congestion of the meninges, scattered subpial hemorrhages,
and congested vessels in the internal capsule, pons
and medulla. In one case there was an extravasation of
blood into the substance of the lower surface of the
orbital lobe. He spoke also of a general chromatolysis
in the ganglion cells. Eder<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in 1917 advanced the theory
that the symptoms of neuroses are the result of mental
conflicts and that the mechanisms involved are those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
attributed by Freud to hysteria. As a result of an analysis
of one hundred cases he reached the conclusion that
mechanical shock, gas poisoning and other physical
traumas were not factors in the production of these conditions.
His cases occurred in persons free from hereditary
or personal psychoneurotic predisposition. Chavigny
in a discussion of the mental diseases in the French
army asserted that psychoses and neuroses were practically
unknown until trench warfare began and the use
of heavy artillery became common. From this moment
psychiatric units became necessities. Ballet and de
Fursac<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> were very firmly of the opinion that shell
shock was due to purely emotional reactions in predisposed
individuals. "If disturbances from explosion and
from emotional shock, existing with or without traumatism,
produce identical results, it is evident that they
have a common factor and this common factor can be
only the emotion itself. Disturbance from explosion
without external injury presupposes an emotional state,
and it is from this state that it derives its causal efficacy;
whatever the etiological complex found as the cause of
a condition of shock, whether the explosion of a shell,
bomb or mine, the sight of the dead, burial in a trench,
wound from an explosion or a missile, there is only one
factor of importance, the emotional factor, which is
essentially responsible for all the neuropsychic disorders
that together make up the shock syndrome."</p>

<p>In 1915 Birnbaum summarized seventy-two articles
written on war psychoneuroses in the German army up
to the middle of March of that year. On analyzing this
study Hoch reached the conclusion that the rate of psychoses
was only about two in ten thousand, which would
appear to be entirely too low. Birnbaum compared the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
statistics of various observers showing the frequency
of psychoses during the first year of the war as follows:&mdash;"Psychopathic
constitution, hysteria, traumatic neuroses,
etc., Bonhöffer, fifty-four per cent; Meyer, 37.5 per
cent; and Hahn forty-three per cent. Alcoholism, acute
and chronic, Bonhöffer, ten per cent; Meyer, 21.5 per
cent; and Hahn, twenty-one per cent. Dementia praecox,
Bonhöffer, seven per cent; Meyer, 7.5 per
cent; and Hahn, thirteen per cent. Epilepsy, Bonhöffer,
fourteen per cent; Meyer, 11.5 per cent; and Hahn, eight
per cent. Manic-depressive insanity, Bonhöffer, three
per cent; Meyer, four per cent; and Hahn, two per cent.
General paralysis, Bonhöffer, six per cent; Meyer, 3.5
per cent; and Hahn, three per cent." In discussing these
findings Hoch says:&mdash;"It is clear from this table that
psychopathic constitutions, various psychogenic reactions,
hysterical and anxiety states, also exhaustive conditions&mdash;all
of which are included in the first group&mdash;are
strikingly frequent; whereas the more serious constitutional
disorders, such as manic-depressive insanity,
dementia praecox and epilepsy are much rarer." Both
Birnbaum and Bonhöffer expressed surprise at the infrequency
of manic-depressive conditions. Wollenberg found
that the individuals who broke down during mobilization,
and who had the least resistance, developed manic-depressive
insanity, paranoid schizophrenias, episodic
psychopathic excitements and occasional clouded states.
The cases appearing at the front, on the other hand, were
largely hysterias, anxiety states and exhaustive conditions.
Birnbaum described psychoses similar to those
reported by Awtokratow in the Russo-Japanese war and
characterized by great weariness with a tendency to weeping,
disturbed sleep and hallucinations related directly
to unpleasant war experiences to which the patients had
been subjected. He attributed these to exhaustion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Lust<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> quotes Mörchen as finding only five cases of war
neuroses in forty thousand prisoners at Darmstadt and
found very few cases in an additional twenty thousand
which he investigated himself.</p>

<p>Westphal in 1915 expressed the opinion that there
were neither war psychoses nor neuroses and that these
conditions did not differ in any way from those described
in times of peace. MacCurdy,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> who made an elaborate
study of war neuroses in 1917, described them as being
either anxiety conditions or simple conversion hysterias.
He looked upon fatigue as being a very important factor
in the development of a neurosis, with either a physical
accident or a mental shock as the precipitating cause.
He defines war neuroses as "Those functional nervous
conditions arising in soldiers which are immediately determined
by modern warfare and have a symptomatology
whose content is directly related to war." MacCurdy
found that concussion could be considered as a possible
factor in less than one-fourth of the cases he observed.
He refers to minute cerebral and retinal hemorrhages
with blood in the cerebrospinal fluid as an evidence that
concussion is a cause in some cases. Curschmann, Meyers,
Buzzard, Farrar and various others have noticed that
the gross hysterical manifestations were extremely rare
in officers. After an extended discussion of the etiology
of the war neuroses, Farrar in 1918 expressed as one
of his conclusions the opinion that "The drift of opinion
is unmistakable towards the psychogenic basis of war
neuroses of all types, including shell shock. Even in
the initial unconsciousness or twilight state of some duration
there is evidence that the psychogenic element may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
have as great if not a greater rôle than the item of mechanical
shock, although this is also important."</p>

<p>Hartung<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> in 1918 reported a study of 780 cases of
war neuroses treated by him at Thal. About ninety-eight
per cent were cured by psychic and mechanical
treatments. One hundred and sixty-two cases showed
hysterical paralysis, the lower limbs being affected twice
as often as the upper. Tremors of the head or upper
limbs were present in twenty-eight per cent, hysterical
convulsions in eight per cent, speech disturbances in
five per cent, hearing disorders in one per cent, cardiac
and respiratory symptoms in 1.5 per cent, neuroses of
the digestive system in 1.5 per cent, and bladder disturbances
in 1.5 per cent of the cases. Neurasthenia "in the
strictest sense of the word" was present in twenty per
cent. Hurst<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and others have spoken of endocrine disturbances
in war neuroses. He includes hyperadrenalism
and hyperthyroidism due to an over-stimulation of the
sympathetic nervous system, resulting from such emotions
as anger and fear. Rapid pulse, enlargement of
the heart, and high blood pressure were common symptoms.
The patients in some cases showed conditions
strongly suggesting Graves' disease. In addition to the
circulatory disturbances there was paroxysmal sweating,
the eyes were slightly prominent, sometimes with von
Graefe's sign, and pilomotor reflexes were present.</p>

<p>An important contribution to the discussion as to the
etiology of war neuroses was the statement made by
Major General Ireland<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> to the Senate Committee on
Military Affairs, that of the twenty-five hundred cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of shell shock awaiting transportation to the United
States, twenty-one hundred recovered within a day or
two after the armistice was declared. He gave the incidence
of mental and nervous diseases in the forces in
camps in this country as 2.5 per thousand and ten per
thousand overseas. Another interesting phase of shell
shock was the surprising results which various German
observers obtained by the so-called "Kaufmann" treatment,
the sudden application of a strong faradic current.
One of the most significant contributions to the
psychiatric history of the war as far as this country is
concerned is the statement made by Col. Salmon<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that
in the latter part of December, 1920, of the beneficiaries
of the War Risk Insurance thirty-two per cent were suffering
from general diseases; forty-one per cent from
tuberculosis; and twenty-seven per cent from various
neuropsychiatric disorders. "The vague idea that all
these men are suffering from "shell shock" or other mysterious
maladies developed under the stress of modern
warfare was replaced by the realization that more than
two-thirds of all neuropsychiatric patients have one or
another type of insanity." Of these cases sixty-six per
cent had well developed psychoses; nineteen per cent
psychoneuroses; five per cent epilepsy; two per cent
mental deficiency; and eight per cent organic nervous
diseases or injuries. On December 16, 1920, there were
five thousand five hundred cases receiving hospital treatment.</p>

<p>The important influence exercised by the glandular
structures on the human organism has long been recognized.
Perhaps the earliest evidence of this is the study
of alterations due to the removal of the sexual glands.
Eunuchoidism was described by Larrey as early as 1812
in his well-known account of the Egyptian campaign. In
1845 Bouchardat advanced the theory that pancreatic lesions
were responsible for the development of diabetic disorders.
Thomas Addison in 1855 showed the existence
of a very definite disease process caused by pathological
conditions in the adrenals. Mongolianism was recognized
as a distinct entity by Langdon-Down in 1866. Gigantism
was studied very thoroughly by von Langer in
1872. The existence of the parathyroids was unknown
until they were described by Sandström in 1880. Weiss
in 1881 showed that the extirpation of the thyroid sometimes
caused tetany. After myxedema had been studied
clinically by Charcot and others the fact that it was
clearly related to disturbances of the functions of the
thyroid gland was demonstrated by Kocher and Reverdin
in 1882. Adipositas Dolorosa was described by Dercum
as a form of dysthyroidia in the same year. Acromegaly
was originally defined by Pierre Marie in 1886 and its
relation to the hypophysis was pointed out by him. In
1886 Möbius called attention to the part played by the
ductless glands in Basedow's disease, Grawitz in 1888
showed the significance of thymic hyperplasia and Paltauf
in the following year described the "lymphato-chlorotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
constitution." The pancreatic origin of diabetes
was elaborately outlined by von Mering and Minkowski
in 1889. The influence exerted by glandular
secretions on general metabolism was demonstrated by
Brown-Sequard in the same year. Lemoine and Launois
in 1891 reported the existence of sclerosis of the blood
and lymph vessels in the pancreas and Laguerse in
1893 found that the Islands of Langerhans were often involved
in diabetes. Thyroigenic obesity was reported by
von Hertoghe in 1896. The isolation and chemical definition
of adrenalin by Takamine in 1901 was a decided
step in advance. Fröhlich in 1901 suggested that obesity,
infantilism of the genitalia and myxedematous alterations
of the skin pointed to tumors of the hypophysis.
In the same year Neumann thoroughly reviewed the subject
of growths in the epiphysis, submitting a study of
twenty-two cases. The various types of dwarfism were
first described by von Hansemann in 1902. Thyroplasia
and myxedema were exhaustively studied by Pineles in
1910 and 1912. The literature on the subject of the ductless
or so-called endocrine glands has grown enormously
during the last two or three decades and is shown in full
by Falta and Meyers.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It will be noted that he associates manic symptoms,
increased emotional irritability, ideas of reference and
persecution with thyroid hyperactivity and speaks of a
sluggish mentality in pituitary deficiency and gonadal
stigmata. Blumgarten's summary of these conditions is
very interesting: "The study of the various stigmata
shows that many of these are present regularly in certain
types of individuals. Consequently we may group individuals
from an endocrine viewpoint into various types
according to the prominent endocrine stigmata which
they show. For example, the nervous, thin individual
with tachycardia, rather prominent eyeballs, fine, delicate
hair, suffering occasionally from gastric symptoms, suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the thyroid type, as does also the clean-cut, alert
individual, and the young woman suffering with amenorrhea
and a tendency to obesity and lethargic mentality.
On the other hand, the aggressive, energetic individual,
with the history of an ancestry subject to vascular disease,
with high blood pressure, with abundant, unusual
distribution of hair and a tendency to pigmentation, suggests
the adrenal type. And so does the tired, asthenic
individual with low blood pressure and Sergent's white
line, who may have had influenza or diphtheria and even
may be suffering from tuberculosis. On the other hand,
however, the heavily built individual with broad, large
frame, wide intercostal angle, broad nose, prominent
supra-orbital ridges, prominent lips, large, square fingers,
suggests the pituitary type. These individuals are
very fond of meats, are heavy eaters, and are constantly
subject to diseases of a gouty nature, may have a history
of syphilis, are often musical and, as a rule, are usually
successful in their particular community."</p>

<p>According to Kaplan<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> "such states as lack of courage,
melancholy, suicidal tendencies, dementia praecox,
precocious adolescence, and immature senility, sadism and
masochism; all of these are possible manifestations in a
gonadotrop individual." Garretson<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> is of the opinion
that the "large group of patients generally misunderstood
and frequently classed in civil life as neurasthenics,
psychasthenics, hysterics, cyclothymics, and hypochondriacs,
is now capable of an intelligent analysis and
rational therapy, if one will concede that these are the
victims of an endocrinic asthenia."</p>

<p>As an evidence of the influence of the endocrine glands
on psychical functions, Falta<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110">
</a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> refers to "the alteration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in character that is almost always associated with the development
of Basedow's disease; to the psychical irritability,
the inclination to irascibility, the manic-euphoristic
attitude of patients with Basedow's disease; to the
apathy and lack of interest of the myxedematous; to the
characteristic quiet mental attitude in hypophysial
dystrophy, and the feeling of mental want of strength
in those suffering with Addison's disease; to the depressive
attitude of the tetany patient, and finally to the
profound influence that the ripening of the sexual glands
at the time of puberty or the loss of function of the sexual
glands in castrates exercises on the psyche." Going
into this subject more in detail Falta gives the following
mental symptoms as associated with Basedow's disease:
abnormal irritability, "immotivated" gaiety, hasty
speech, rapid flow of thoughts, a suggestion of flight of
ideas, changeable moods and terrifying dreams. He also
finds an alteration in the personality as shown by suspiciousness,
capriciousness, irritability and either euphoric
or depressed tendencies. Möbius compares this with
a condition of mild intoxication associated with maniacal
periods alternating with depression. Occasional attacks
of delirium with confusion and hallucinations terminating
in coma have been described. Sattler, who has analyzed
150 of these cases as reported in current literature,
classifies over seventy as cases of manic-depressive insanity.
Boinet, Parhan and others have shown that depression
with suicidal inclinations may follow the ingestion
of large amounts of thyroidin. Conditions of excitement
have also been reported in thyroidism, and, according
to Falta, are not uncommon. Brunet has expressed
the opinion that in such cases Basedow's disease acts
only as a precipitating factor in an individual predisposed
to a psychosis.</p>

<p>The English Myxedema Commission found the apathy
characteristic of that disease present in all but three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of 109 cases. This condition develops early and may
manifest itself in the form of a mild mental dulness.
Intellectual activities are often markedly diminished and
there is a slow, monotonous form of speech. Deterioration
may be well developed and memory seriously impaired.
The commission in its investigations found
illusions in eighteen cases, hallucinations in sixteen and
psychoses in sixteen. These took the form usually of a
depression with occasional excitements. The symptoms,
in some cases at least, disappeared after thyroid treatment
was instituted.</p>

<p>The psychic changes in cretinism have been made the
subject of considerable study. The usual mental state is,
of course, one of feeblemindedness. Perception has been
shown to be disturbed, memory is impaired and there
is a marked emotional deterioration and instability.</p>

<p>In the parathyroid form of tetany von Frankl-Hochwart
found depressions and confused states with hallucinations.
Depressions were reported by him in fourteen
of thirty-seven cases examined. Excitements were also
noted in some instances. Falta refers to "a characteristic
apathy, a want of initiative, and a slowing of speech"
in acromegaly. In rare cases he has also noted mental
exaltation. Oppenheim (1914) has called attention to
cases of acromegaly presenting the picture of general
paresis but due to an alteration of glandular functions
and not syphilitic in origin.</p>

<p>Falta includes the following in his description of the
symptomatology of Addison's disease: "Almost always
the disease manifests itself in ready fatigability, disinclination
for work, and apathy; to these symptoms are
sometimes added headaches, poor sleep, sometimes obstinate
insomnia, psychical ill humor and depression,
often too, abnormal irritability; further, diminution in
memory, noises in the ears, vertigo and commonly fainting
attacks, singultus, and rheumatoid pains in the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and in the extremities, sometimes, also epileptiform convulsions.
Extremely stormy manifestations on the part
of the nervous system may, especially in the later stages,
make their appearance&mdash;violent delirium, acute confusion,
convulsions, deep stupor, and coma."</p>

<p>Raeder<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> has made an analysis of glandular involvements
found in the study of one hundred cases of feeblemindedness
at autopsy. He classifies these as 1, extreme
changes&mdash;in which three or four glands were involved and
where there were marked anomalies of growth, underdevelopment,
disproportion of the body parts, etc.; 2,
marked changes&mdash;in which at least two glands were involved
and where there were distinct changes in growth
and anomalous development; 3, moderate changes&mdash;in
which one or two glands were involved; and 4, cases
where no glandular involvement was found. He noted
extreme changes in ten per cent of the series, marked
changes in eleven per cent, moderate changes in fifty-three
per cent and none at all in twenty-six per cent.
Sixty per cent of these individuals showed deviation from
the normal in size, fifty-one per cent were undersized and
nine per cent were above the average height, while thirty-eight
per cent were normal. The pituitary was found to
be involved in forty per cent of the one hundred cases,
the thyroid in nineteen per cent, the suprarenal in
twenty-seven per cent, the sex glands in thirty-eight per
cent, the thymus in twelve per cent and other glands in
six per cent. He frequently found several involved:
"Pituitary with gonads in nine cases, was the most common
dual adenosis, though there were combinations of
sex and thyroid in four instances, sex and suprarenal in
four cases, and in three cases the thyroids, pituitary and
gonads were affected in triple involvement. Furthermore,
there were six cases in which the gonads were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
combined with three other glands; two included the
gonads, thyroid, pituitary and suprarenal; two, gonads,
thyroid, pituitary and thymus." Further investigation
only can accurately determine the exact relation which
exists between disturbance of these glands and the presence
of mental deficiency.</p>

<p>Attention was called some time since to the fact that
the injection of adrenalin leads to an increase in blood
pressure. This has been discussed by Falta, Newburgh,
Nobel and others. Neubürger<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> made a study of thirty-nine
cases, seven of which were normal, the others including
alcoholism, neurasthenia, manic-depressive, etc., but
not dementia praecox. A fairly well marked rise of blood
pressure followed adrenalin injection very quickly,
reaching its maximum in from six to twelve minutes. He
found the reaction diminished or absent in eighty per cent
of the sixty-three cases of dementia praecox which he
examined, but does not advance the claim that this can be
utilized for diagnostic purposes. Walter and Krumbach<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
found an increased pressure in sixty per cent
of normal control cases and obtained similar reactions in
dementia praecox. Schmidt, on the other hand, confirmed
the findings of Neubürger. Emerson<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> found status
lymphaticus in over twenty-nine per cent of his cases of
dementia praecox and Davis<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> found the same condition
in twenty-four per cent of war neuroses in a series of over
one hundred cases. These findings, however, lack confirmation
by other observers. Straus<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> includes as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
mental symptoms in thyroidal disbalance: sluggish mental
reactions alternating with sparkling wit, irritability,
general moodiness and depression, difficulty in thought
with inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, fatigability
and somnolence.</p>

<p>Turro<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> has shown that all of the physical evidences
of fright&mdash;pallor, dilatation of the pupils, rapid
pulse, cutis anserinus, perspiration, etc., can be produced
experimentally by the injection of epinephrin in certain
cases. Knauer and Billigheimer<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> have called attention
to the striking similarity between the functional
changes to be found in disturbances of the vegetative
(sympathetic) nervous system and certain manifestations
associated with fear neuroses. They attribute these disturbances
to congenital inferiority, toxic sources, emotional
shock or fatigue.</p>

<p>A uniform defective development of the physical and
mental personality of the individual has been designated
by Lasègue as infantilismus. As described by Di Gaspero
and de Sanctis the mental status of these cases belongs
to the domain of feeblemindedness and in some
instances to imbecility. According to Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the
attention is easily attracted and as easily distracted.
These individuals are inquisitive and flighty. Apprehension
is defective. What they hear and see can only
be related in a fragmentary and unreliable manner. They
often learn readily and forget as quickly. Pende described
the mental development as only one-third of the
normal. Memory gaps are supplied by exaggeration and
fabrication, as influenced by emotion or suggestion. Di
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Gaspero found falsification of memory in twenty per cent
of his cases. Imagination is very active with a tendency
to dreamlike unrealities, wonderful tales of adventure,
etc. Mental processes are inadequate, vague and uncertain.
The real and the unreal are not clearly differentiated.
Explanations and descriptions are inaccurate
and indefinite. Standards of value, size or time are
vague. The store of ideas is impoverished and associations
are poor. Calculations are slow and faulty. These
persons are illogical, impractical and credulous. They
are swayed by prejudices, catchwords and hasty judgment.
Their range of thought is narrow and their viewpoint
of life childish. The emotional and volitional content
is immature. They are cheerful but lack earnestness,
and are often ambitious and boastful. At other times
they are likely to be despondent, timid, anxious, fearful
and lacking in self-confidence. The mood is exceedingly
variable. They are not industrious, cannot apply themselves
constantly to any line of work, and tire easily.
Their conduct is very uncertain and unreliable.
Some have criminal tendencies. Occasionally hysterical
symptoms appear. Evidences of an absence
of physical development manifest themselves in all
varieties of immaturity. These defects, according
to Falta, are shown especially in the genitalia and
the lymphatic apparatus, with a delay in the closure
of the epiphysis and the retention of a childish physique
generally. The skeletal framework shows a failure of
development, the lower length of the body exceeds the
upper slightly, if at all, the head is relatively large, the
bones slender and the pelvis infantile in type. The
sexual organs and the "vita sexualis" are those of a
child. The blood shows a large lymphocyte count and a
definite status lymphaticus is sometimes found to be present.
The hairy development of the pubis and axillary
surface is slight. The internal organs are normal. True<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
infantilism, according to Falta, is not due to a glandular
disturbance. He also maintains that the mind, while
that of a child, is normal otherwise and shows no defects.
Juvenile myxedema, hypophysial dystrophy and eunuchoidism,
Falta would not include with the infantilismus
group. Infantilism has been ascribed to syphilis, tuberculosis,
alcoholism, etc., of the parents. Brissaud in
1907 advanced the theory that it was a hypothyroid symptom.
His views have been supported by various other
writers, although not shared by either Falta or Kraepelin.
The latter has also described mental conditions more
or less suggesting feeblemindedness and associated with
lesions of the hypophysis, the pineal gland, the adrenals,
the sexual glands and the thymus.</p>

<p>Lesions in the anterior lobe of the pituitary result in
gigantism or acromegaly, with a childish mentality most
marked in the emotional sphere. These persons are
usually indifferent, good-natured and boastful, and at
the same time clumsy and inactive. A diminished activity
of the glandular portion of the hypophysis means
dwarfism. Lesions of the posterior or "nervous" lobe
may cause "dystrophia adiposo genitalis," the "adipositas
dolorosa" of Dercum. The mental status in this condition
Kraepelin compares to that described in acromegaly&mdash;apathy
and indifference, with occasional restless
or excited types. The intellectual capacity may be normal,
mediocre or somewhat deficient.</p>

<p>The pineal gland is spoken of as having a very definite
relation to sexual development. Extirpation is said
to lead to rapid development of the body, the accumulation
of fat and early sexual development,&mdash;a condition
described by Pellizzi as "makro-genitosomia praecoce."
Schüller in fifty-one cases with pineal involvements
found ten occurring during the first decade of life. Death
usually takes place within a few months or years. Similar
conditions result from hyperactivity of the adrenal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
cortex,&mdash;rapid development of the body, and particularly
of the sexual organs, obesity and overgrowth of the hair
and beard. Wiesel described as a "suprarenal genital
symptom complex" cases of pseudo-hermaphrodism in
women.</p>

<p>Lesions of the adrenal, as studies of Addison's disease
show, have, according to Kraepelin,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the following
symptoms: weakness of memory, apathy, dulness, inactivity
and inhibition of growth. He also calls attention
to the fact that in anencephaly, hemicephaly and microcephaly
defective development of the adrenals is very
common. "Eunuchoidismus" and "viriginität" with
mental symptoms due to defective development of the
sex glands are also described. The physical manifestations
include defective secondary sexual characteristics,
in men in the growth of the beard and change of the
voice, and in women in the development of the mammary
glands, the fat deposits and the curve of the hips. There
is a failure of sexual development and absence of
menses, as well as defective physical growth. Eunuchoidismus
may manifest itself in a giantism somewhat
suggesting that resulting from lesions of the pituitary
or in a dwarflike physical development. The former
variety is characterized by an unusual height with long
arms and legs. The forehead is receding, with a low hair
line. The external genitals are very small and there is
little pubic or axillary hair. Ossification is delayed. In
the second form (dwarfs) the body, arms and legs are
short and thick. The head is large and the neck short.
The genitals are small and the penis is short and button-shaped.
Hair formation is slight. The mental condition
in either case is characterized by an intellectual
defect with timidity, emotional instability, helplessness
and weakness of will, sometimes with an active imagination.
Kraepelin also describes endocrine conditions resulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
from thymic lesions&mdash;thymic idiocy, status thymolymphaticus&mdash;and
mentions the pancreatic infantilismus
referred to by Brownell, Basedow's disease, acromegaly,
pluriglandular insufficiency and other conditions
already mentioned. Kraepelin has encountered only
seven "dysadenoid" forms in a study of 244 cases.
Bourneville has reported 104 cases of persistent thymus.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting contributions to the literature
of endocrinology is Mott's<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> suggestion that dementia
praecox is due to a combination of degenerative
changes in the cortical neurones and the generative
organs. As a result of the study of twenty-two cases of
dementia praecox he found that more marked pathological
changes were found in the testes than were observed in
cases of manic-depressive insanity, alcoholic psychoses,
epilepsy or paranoia. The characteristic findings consisted
in regressive changes in the seminal tubules and
abnormal staining reactions in the spermatozoa. He
found more evidences of virility in a senile individual of
eighty than in any of his cases of dementia praecox. His
theory as to the pathogenesis of the disease is based on
the fact that the changes in the neurones are of the same
character&mdash;a degeneration of the nuclear elements.
These findings have not at this time been confirmed by
other observers.</p>

<p>Timme<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> has described a psychic makeup due to
subinvolution of the thymus. "The mental picture presented
by these subinvoluted thymic states is also of great
importance, for analogous to their structural lack of differentiation
is their psychic makeup. They remain child-like
in their character, so that they are self-centered;
simple in their mental processes and imitative; looking
for protection and care, and more or less unfitted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the active struggles of life. They are obstinate and negativistic;
if, however, an efficient compensation takes
place, then, although the mental development may have
been delayed, it nevertheless seems finally to reach complete
maturity; and these individuals are among the
brightest and most intelligent of their community." In
cases of precocious involution of the thymus he finds the
mental condition to be of chief interest. "They are precocious,
with much initiative, are easily aroused to anger
and are resentful. They have cruel instincts and show
little inhibition. Although they seem far advanced for
their years while still young, yet they never seem thoroughly
to mature, and become blocked in early adolescence.
They seem to retain their impulsive, unreasoning
characteristics, brook no restraint and remain constantly
a prey to their easily aroused anger." Of thyroid insufficiency
he says: "Mentally, the patient is dull, sluggish
and with little initiative. He moves slowly and
thinks slowly, is extremely forgetful and his lethargy is
occasionally disturbed by outbursts of anger due probably
to his maladjustment to the more quickly moving
world about him." In his summary of the hyperthyroid
makeup, Timme says: "Both mind and body are everlastingly
busy. And not only with present problems, but
anticipatory of tomorrow's as well. The patient shows
no rest or relaxation. His mind, filled with echoes of
the day's troubles, prevents his falling to sleep until
long after he retires, and he is again awake and immediately
on the "qui vive" as soon as daylight comes."
Statistics on endocrine conditions are unfortunately not
available as yet.</p>

<span class="st">THE MODERN PROGRESS OF PSYCHIATRY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The remarkable accomplishments of medical science
during the last few decades may be looked upon as a
fairly accurate index of modern progress in general.
Nor have these advances been confined to any limited
field. Standards of education have changed with almost
startling rapidity. The most extended course of instruction
open to medical students fifty or sixty years ago
covered a period of two years. Qualifications for entrance
consisted in little more than a demonstration of
the candidate's ability to pay the required matriculation
fee. The three year course, only recently established
and generally recognized, was lengthened to four years
during the latter part of the nineteenth century. The
number of medical colleges has been materially reduced
and the size of the graduating classes has decreased fifty
per cent or more during the last twenty-five years as a
result of the higher standards. Several of our medical
schools admit college graduates only and two years of
college work is now a minimum entrance requirement in
institutions of the highest type. Very few men feel
properly equipped for taking up the practice of medicine
today until they have had an experience of at least a year
in a general hospital. The profession is tending more
and more towards specialization and the old-fashioned
general practitioner is now at a considerable disadvantage.
Ophthalmology has become almost an exact science.
Gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatrists, orthopedists,
laryngologists, neurologists and internists are looked
upon as almost indispensable in a community of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
size. All of these specialists are more or less dependent
on the cooperation of a pathologist, who can do nothing
without a well equipped laboratory at his disposal. Surgery
has long been regarded as a specialty which required
an extended training as well as years of experience.</p>

<p>The progress of modern medical science has been
almost bewildering. It has been a comparatively short
time since the principles of antisepsis and asepsis were
established by Lister. The plasmodium of malaria was
described in 1880. It was not until 1882 that the tubercle
bacillus was discovered by Koch. Diphtheria was rendered
an almost harmless disease by the discovery of a
specific antitoxin. The uncertainties relating to the diagnosis
of typhoid fever were entirely removed when the
Widal reaction came into general use. The Roentgen
ray has revolutionized surgery. The diagnostic and
therapeutic use of tuberculin has been of inestimable
value to internal medicine. Schaudinn's discovery of the
treponema pallidum in 1905 cleared up one of the greatest
scientific mysteries of modern times. The introduction
of salvarsan has added a new and important chapter
to our history of therapeutics. The Wassermann reaction
represents probably the most important diagnostic
discovery of the century. The recent studies of the so-called
ductless glands have opened up new and important
fields of research which promise to be far-reaching in
their results. Social service, unknown only a few years
ago, is now an indispensable adjunct of the modern hospital
organization. Training schools for nurses have
become highly specialized educational institutions.</p>

<p>What is to be said of the progress made in our knowledge
of mental diseases? Certainly much has been
accomplished during the last century. The earliest
American contributor to this branch of medicine was
Benjamin Rush (1745-1813), professor in the Medical
Department of the University of Pennsylvania, member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the Continental Congress, a signer of the Declaration
of Independence and one time physician-in-chief to the
American armies. His "Medical Inquiries and Observations
into Diseases of the Mind," which appeared in
1812 was the first publication of the kind in this country.
It is interesting to note that he condemned the misuse
of mechanical restraint, advocated hydrotherapy and
recommended the appointment of instructors to direct
the employment and amusement of patients. Incidentally
he was the chairman of a committee appointed by the
College of Physicians of Philadelphia to memorialize
Congress and the legislature of Pennsylvania on the evils
of alcoholism. Reference should also be made to the fact
that he opposed capital punishment, advocated the abolition
of slavery and objected to the study of the classics
as a required part of the college curriculum. He even
favored woman suffrage. In addition to his other activities
this remarkable man was treasurer at one time of the
United States Mint, vice-president of the American Bible
Society, one of the founders of Dickinson College and
associated for many years with Franklin in the work of
the American Philosophical Society. Certainly he was
many years in advance of his time. When his work on
"Diseases of the Mind" appeared, the word psychiatry
was unknown in this country. The term lunatic, which
first appeared in the English statutes in 1320, during the
reign of Edward the Second, was still in quite general
use. The only state hospital for mental diseases was the
one at Williamsburg, Virginia. Such institutions were
universally known as asylums for many years.</p>

<p>Insanity was generally discussed in the terminology
of Pinel and Esquirol as including mania, melancholia,
dementia and idiocy. Those not thoroughly familiar with
the psychiatry of the past may not understand the sense
in which the word dementia was employed. It was defined
by Esquirol in the following terms: "There exists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
therefore, a form of mental alienation which is very
distinct&mdash;in which the disorder of the ideas, affections
and determinations is characterized by feebleness and
by the abolition, more or less marked, of all the sensitive,
intellectual, and voluntary faculties. This is dementia."
It was looked upon usually as a terminal state following
excitements or depressions and in some rare instances as
being primary in origin.</p>

<p>There have been many important developments in
psychiatry since the days of Benjamin Rush. The mania,
melancholia and dementia of the eighteenth century have
apparently gone for all time. The events of the last
hundred years include more particularly the delimitation
and complete differentiation of general paresis, the
rise and fall of the paranoia concept, the description of
the traumatic psychoses, the establishment of the alcoholic
insanities as clinical entities, a study of the mental
diseases due to endogenous and exogenous toxins, the
recognition of the neuroses and psychoneuroses in their
modern sense, the addition of the psychopathic personalities
to our classification and the definition of manic-depressive
insanity, dementia praecox and involutional
melancholia. The mental states due to somatic conditions
have been exhaustively studied and the psychoses associated
with epilepsy and pellagra have been fully investigated.
Psychology and psychiatry have been definitely
correlated and pathological research placed upon a firm
foundation. The psychiatric phraseology of today would
have been practically meaningless to the students of
Pinel. Curiously enough the word psychiatry, which
goes back to nearly 1800 in the literature of Germany and
Italy has only been used for a few years in this country
and England. The word psychosis is of even more recent
origin.</p>

<p>This modern era may be said to have been ushered in
by the preliminary studies made of general paresis by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Haslam in 1798. These were followed by the researches
of Bayle, Delaye and finally Calmeil, which definitely
established the integrity of that disease as a clinical
entity. Even then its specific origin was only a matter
of conjecture. When Esmarch and Jessen suggested
that general paresis was a syphilitic disease in 1857, their
views were rejected by men as prominent as Charcot and
Déjerine. Although paranoia is a term which has appeared
in the literature of medicine for centuries, it has
only had the significance now attached to it since the
latter part of the nineteenth century. Its description was
foreshadowed perhaps by the monomania of Esquirol
and Pritchard and the partial insanity of Rush and
others. Heinroth, Griesinger, Magnan, Lasègue, Régis,
Falret, Mendel, Krafft-Ebing, Herz, Snell, Werner,
Schüle, Ziehen, Kraepelin and many other well-known
psychiatrists have played a part in the evolution of paranoia
which only definitely displaced the wahnsinn, verrüchtheit,
and various other designations of the earlier
writers, in the neighborhood of 1890. Paranoia is a term
which has only been infrequently used since the general
acceptance of Kraepelin's paranoid forms of dementia
praecox. Its territory has been still further invaded by
paraphrenia, the fate of which, however, is somewhat
uncertain as yet. The forerunners of the psychopathic
personalities were the moral insanity of Pritchard, the
insanity of degeneracy of Morel, Magnan, Régis, Lombroso,
etc., and the "demifous et demiresponsables" of
Grasset, Trélat and others. The introduction of the
"constitutional inferiority" idea into the psychiatry of
this country was directly attributable to Adolf Meyer following
the work of Koch in Germany. After the elaborate
study of alcoholism made by Magnus Huss in 1852
the psychoses due to that condition were described by
Bonhöffer, Magnan, Korsakow, Kraepelin and various
other writers. The psychoneuroses represent the developments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of Brachet, who wrote on hysteria in 1847, Briquet,
Oppenheim, Lasègue, Möbius, Charcot, Janet, Babinski,
Beard, Kraepelin and many others. To Meyer
again we are indebted for the first exhaustive study and
classification of the traumatic psychoses. The description
of amentia by Meynert in 1881 was of considerable
significance. The first comprehensive study of mental
disorders associated with the use of cocaine was made by
Erlenmeyer in 1886. The same writer was responsible
for the first elaborate investigation of morphinism in the
year following. Circular insanity was described by
Falret in 1851 and again as "folie à double forme" by
Baillarger in 1854. Hecker was responsible for an event
of great importance in the history of psychiatry when he
published his description of hebephrenia in 1871. Kahlbaum
in his "Katatonia" made a contribution which was
destined to influence the future of medicine in 1874.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile what is to be said as to the progress
of pathological research? The earliest contribution to
psychiatry from that point of view was made by Morgagni
in 1761, his opinions being based on the autopsy
reports in some thirteen cases. Greding in 1790 published
the results of autopsies in a series of thirty-seven
cases. The findings at that time included variations in
the thickness of the skull, adhesions and thickenings of
the dura, changes in the consistency of the cerebrum and
cerebellum, effusions into the ventricles and various gross
defects. The early writers attached a great deal of
importance to the pineal gland changes. These pathological
conditions were so generally reported, that Portal
in the eighteenth century went so far as to say that
"Morbid alteration in the brain or spinal marrow has
been so constantly observed, that I should greatly prefer
to doubt the sufficiency of my senses, if I should not at
any time discover any morbid change in the brain, than
to believe that mental disease could exist without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
physical disorder in this viscus, or in one or other of
its appurtenances." Pinel spoke very discouragingly,
however, of the results and Esquirol finally reached the
conclusion that nothing really important had been accomplished
after all. In his Charenton reports (1835) he
expressed himself on this subject as follows:&mdash;"However
important may have been the researches of anatomists
made during our days into diseases which affect the
mind, we may venture to repeat that pathological anatomy
is yet silent as to the seat of madness, and that it
has not yet demonstrated what is the precise alteration
in the encephalon which gives rise to this disease. What
shall we, then, think of the rash pretensions of those who
assume that they can fix upon the diseased portion of the
brain, judging merely from the character of the disease?"
In 1836 Guislain summarized the various lesions found
in insanity at autopsy under nine headings&mdash;congestion
of the brain or meninges or both, serous congestion of
the same, cerebral softening, adhesions of the membranes
to each other or to the brain, cerebral induration, cerebral
hypertrophy, and abnormalities of the brain or
skull. The appointment of a pathologist at the Utica
State Hospital in 1868 as a result of the remarkable interest
taken in this subject by Dr. John P. Gray must be
looked upon as one of the important events in the history
of American psychiatry. The later developments of the
nineteenth century included studies of general paresis,
cerebral syphilis, arteriosclerosis, senility, epilepsy,
mental deficiency, pellagra and various other somatic
conditions. It may fairly be said, at least, that pathology
has kept fully abreast of the progress made by
clinical psychiatry during the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all of these advances, the generally
recognized mental diseases, as late as 1895, included the
following types:&mdash;mania, melancholia, dementia, imbecility,
idiocy, general paresis, chronic delusional insanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
or paranoia and senile insanity. This was in substance
the psychiatry of Savage, Maudsley, Clouston, Blandfield,
Régis, Chapin, Kellogg, Spitzka, Kirchoff, Berkley
and many other well-known writers of a comparatively
recent date. A new era in the history of mental medicine
was ushered in by Kraepelin when the sixth edition of
his "Psychiatrie" appeared in 1899. This established
manic-depressive insanity and dementia praecox as clinical
entities. Kraepelin called attention to the fact that
excitements and depressions frequently recur in the same
individual, often with frequent attacks but with no
marked tendency towards mental enfeeblement. This
class of cases he grouped together as manic-depressive
psychoses and pointed out certain characteristics common
to the excitements and depressions included. He
showed that certain other forms of depression marked
by anxiety, fear, restlessness, self-accusation, marked
suicidal tendencies, etc., were common to the involutional
period of life. To this anxious depression the name involution
melancholia has been applied, although Kraepelin
is now somewhat in doubt as to its differentiation
from the manic-depressive group. To certain other cases
characterized by emotional dulness, apathy, hallucinations
with phantastic delusions, and in some types, mannerisms,
negativism, stereotypy, verbigeration, etc.,
tending sooner or later towards deterioration, he attached
the name dementia praecox. This included the
hebephrenia of Hecker and the katatonia of Kahlbaum.</p>

<p>Wernicke in 1906 advanced the hypothesis that psychical
symptoms may be attributed to disturbances of
various association mechanisms. These interruptions
were to be found in various parts of the psychical reflex
arcs. This included the psychosensory tracts or receptive
mechanisms, the intrapsychical tracts or elaboration
mechanisms and the psychomotor mechanisms. Manic-depressive
psychoses were looked upon as representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
a disorder of the intrapsychic mechanism, while dementia
praecox was considered to be an illustration of a disturbance
of the psychomotor mechanisms. This was an
exceedingly interesting but purely theoretical scheme for
putting psychiatry on a definite anatomical and pathological
basis.</p>

<p>The progress made by Kraepelin, Stransky, Wernicke,
Bleuler, Ziehen and other modern psychiaters led to renewed
interest in pathological research. This was to a
considerable extent due to the suggestion of Kraepelin
that dementia praecox was autotoxic and endogenous in
origin. The neurons were exhaustively studied by Alzheimer
and changes in metabolism thoroughly investigated
by Folin and many others. To the researches of
Nissl and Alzheimer in 1904 we are largely indebted for
an accurate knowledge of general paresis. Studies of
the cortex in dementia praecox by Alzheimer and many
others have been extremely interesting if not conclusive.
The introduction of lumbar puncture by Quincke and the
studies of the cerebrospinal fluid made by Widal, Plaut,
Nonne, Mott and others were of great aid in diagnostic
procedure. These have been supplemented by the Wassermann
reaction, the colloidal gold test, etc. The isolation
of the treponema pallidum in the cortex settled the
question of the identity of general paresis and cerebral
syphilis for all time.</p>

<p>Another line of research responsible in no small measure
for the remarkable progress of psychiatry during the
last few decades was that instituted by Freud, Jung
and others in their studies of psychological mechanisms.
It is a rather remarkable fact that it is only in comparatively
recent years that a study of the psychological
processes of the normal mind has been looked upon as
essential to an understanding of the mental reactions involved
in the development of a psychoneurosis or psychosis.
This is really the basis of Freud's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychiatry may be said to be practically the only
branch of medical science in which a study of pathological
processes has not been based largely upon physiological
and anatomical foundations. Our textbooks for
many years have insisted that "insanity" was a disease
of the brain but have not given much consideration to a
correlation of the physiology with the pathology of that
organ. The application of psychological methods to psychiatric
research was largely a result of the studies of
hysteria by Janet. This was supplemented by the important
contribution of Breuer and Freud in 1895 calling
attention to their theories in regard to the production of
the psychoneuroses by psychic traumas, usually of a
sexual nature. Freud's views were outlined more fully
in his "Selected Papers on Hysteria," "Three Contributions
to the Sexual Theory," and his studies of the
"Psychopathology of Everyday Life," etc. The psychological
processes of dementia praecox and paranoia were
subjected to elaborate studies by Freud, Jung and various
other authors.</p>

<p>The relation existing between psychology and psychiatry
has been placed on a very practical basis by the
studies of shell shock and other hysterical conditions so
important during the recent war. Probably nothing will
contribute more towards a recognition of the importance
of psychiatry than the discovery made early in the war
that mental diseases and defects were responsible for
more disabilities than were attributable to almost any
other single cause. Certainly the inactivity of many
years has been followed by an awakening which has
placed modern psychiatry on a dignified plane and its
progress will now compare favorably with the accomplishments
of any other branch of medicine. The statement
is, I think, justified, that psychiatry has been established
on a thoroughly scientific basis as the result of
the work of comparatively few years. We have, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
reached a stage where careful analyses should be made of
the clinical data upon which future progress entirely depends.</p>

<p>A brief consideration of existing conditions should be
sufficient to show this conclusively. Psychiatric literature
is, and for many years has been, characterized
largely by an unfortunate absence of accurate scientific
information which would warrant the conclusions reached
in many instances by the authors of our textbooks. We
have been subjected to an avalanche of theories and a
remarkable paucity of facts. In the discussion of abstract
propositions where concrete evidence is not obtainable
this is of course unavoidable. There has, however,
been a very noticeable oversight of many facts which
the wealth of clinical material in our hospitals has placed
at our disposal. Our literature has been filled with too
many unsubstantiated statements. There is no reason
why many of the views entertained by various authorities
should be matters of personal opinion or based entirely
on individual observation. The fact that there are over
two hundred thousand cases of mental disease in the state
hospitals of this country, with an admission rate of sixty
thousand annually, is sufficient evidence to justify the
statement that there is no lack of material for accurate
studies.</p>

<p>A brief reference to some of the discrepancies shown
in a consideration of the various psychoses will serve to
illustrate the need of more accurate information on many
of these subjects. In discussing the predisposing causes
of mental diseases, for instance, White<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> made the following
statement, which is perfectly correct: "An inherited
predisposition to mental disorder is found in
from 30 to 90 per cent of cases according to different
authorities, while the average for all conditions has been
estimated at from 60 to 70 per cent." Information on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
this subject is certainly far from being complete or satisfactory.
The Thirty-first annual report of the State Hospital
Commission shows that of 4,492 first admissions to
the New York hospitals during the year ending June 30,
1919, 2,003, or 44.6 per cent, were reported as having a
family history of insanity, nervous diseases, alcoholism
or other neuropathic taint. As far as could be determined
55.4 per cent showed no evidence of heredity in their
family history. The necessity of further information on
this important subject would appear to be obvious. The
question as to the relation between syphilis and general
paresis may be said to have been definitely settled for all
time. The origin of this disease has, however, been the
subject of controversy since 1857. Paton<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> in a review
of this discussion in 1905 states that Gudden found a history
of syphilis in 35.7 per cent of his cases, Hirsch, in
fifty-six per cent, Jolly, in sixty-nine, Mendel, in seventy-five,
and Alzheimer, in ninety per cent. In the light of
our present knowledge this difference of opinion and experience
is quite interesting and illuminating.</p>

<p>The most extravagant and misleading statements
made about etiological factors, perhaps, are those which
relate to the alcoholic psychoses. This was due largely
to the statements of enthusiastic propagandists who were
advocating prohibitory legislation. The facts of the matter
are that when the use of liquor was unrestricted, the
admission rate of alcoholic psychoses, as shown by the
New York state hospital reports, had averaged ten per
cent for a number of years (1908 to 1913).</p>

<p>Frequent contributions have been made from time
to time to the literature of psychiatry on the subject of
dementia praecox. Voluminous articles have been written
on its pathology, psychological mechanisms, etiology,
etc. Many of the theories advanced are not in harmony
with what little definite information we possess. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the theses on this subject have been based on the
study of a surprisingly small number of cases. The
statement has been made<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> that attacks either of a syncopal
or epileptic nature are among the most important
physical symptoms of dementia praecox, and "occur in
about eighteen per cent of the cases." In his eighth edition
Kraepelin speaks of convulsive attacks of various
sorts in sixteen per cent of all cases of dementia praecox,
and says that they also occur in a few cases of manic-depressive
insanity. These findings are certainly not consistent
with those of other observers. In a review of
eight hundred cases, five hundred of dementia praecox,
one hundred and eighty of manic-depressive insanity and
sixty in each of the "allied to" groups, Simon<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> found
convulsions in less than one per cent of the total number
of cases in which epilepsy or organic conditions could
be definitely excluded. In a study of 367 cases of dementia
praecox Ullman<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> found convulsive manifestations
in 2.7 per cent of the total. He also reported seizures
in 1.4 per cent of 340 cases of manic-depressive insanity.
Kraepelin formerly held that recovery was to be expected
in about eight per cent of the cases of hebephrenic
dementia praecox and thirteen per cent of the cases of
katatonia (seventh edition). Notwithstanding this, he
says in his eighth edition in one place:<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> "Further investigations
of a series of observations carried on extensively
and carefully for decades must show how far
the view, which is gaining in probability for myself, is
correct, that permanent and complete recoveries of dementia
praecox, though they may perhaps occur, still in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
any event belong to the rarities." As Kraepelin himself
suggests, the widely varying views on this subject are
due to different conceptions as to what constitutes dementia
praecox and what is to be considered a cure. Certainly
we are in need of further information. On June
30, 1918, there were 37,352 patients in the state hospitals
of New York.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Twenty-one thousand nine hundred and
two cases were diagnosed as dementia praecox. Fifty-four
of these were discharged as recovered during the
year. This represents 3.2 per cent of the 1,687 cases
discharged as recovered, 2.8 per cent of the 1,883 cases of
dementia praecox admitted during that period (first admissions)
and .2 per cent of the 21,902 cases of dementia
praecox in the hospitals. The reports of the State Psychopathic
Hospital at the University of Michigan show
1.19 per cent of recoveries in the cases of dementia praecox
discharged during a period of eleven years. Reference
is made to these discrepancies not in any spirit of
criticism but for the purpose of pointing out the necessity
of utilizing such facts as may be available.</p>

<p>There is nothing new about this suggestion. It was
strenuously advocated by Louis, the founder of one of
the greatest French schools of medicine many years ago.
This was referred to by his pupil and admirer, Oliver
Wendell Holmes, in his farewell address to the Harvard
Medical School in 1882 in the following words: "The
'numerical system,' of which Louis was the greatest advocate,
if not the absolute originator, was an attempt to
substitute series of carefully recorded facts, rigidly
counted and closely compared, for those never-ending
records of vague, unverifiable conclusions with which the
classics of the healing art were overloaded. The history
of practical medicine had been like the story of Danaides.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
'Experience' had been, from time immemorial, pouring
its flowing treasures into buckets full of holes."</p>

<p>A determined effort has been made by the American
Psychiatric Association to correlate the activities of the
various state hospitals for mental diseases and utilize
the great wealth of clinical material within the walls of
these institutions for such studies as may promote the
advancement of psychiatry. With this end in view a
committee was appointed at the annual meeting at Niagara
Falls in 1913 to formulate a plan for the compilation
of statistical data relating to mental diseases. The
conclusions reached by this committee are illustrated by
the following quotation from their report in 1917: "That
the statistical data annually compiled by the various
institutions for the insane throughout the country should
be uniform in plan and scope is no longer open to question.
The lack of such uniformity makes it absolutely impossible
at the present time to collect comparative statistics
concerning mental diseases in different states and
countries, and extremely difficult to secure comparative
data relative to movement of patients, administration and
cost of maintenance and additions. The importance and
need of some system whereby uniformity in reports would
be secured have been repeatedly emphasized by officers
and members of this Association, by statisticians of the
United States Census Bureau, by editors of psychiatric
journals, and by administrative officials in various states.
We should know accurately the forms of mental disease
occurring in all parts of the country; we should know
the movement of patients in every hospital for the insane;
we should know the cost of maintenance of patients
and the amounts spent for additions and improvements
in every state hospital; we should be able to compile annually
complete data concerning these and other matters,
and compute rates and draw comparisons therefrom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Such data would serve as the basis for constructive work
in raising the standard of care of the insane, as a guide
for preventive effort, and as an aid to the progress of
psychiatry."</p>

<p>A permanent committee on statistics has been maintained
by the Association since 1913. The following statistical
tables were officially adopted some years ago and
are now in general use: 1. General information; 2.
Financial statement; 3. Movement of patients; 4. Nativity
and parentage of first admissions; 5. Citizenship of
first admissions; 6. Psychoses of first admissions, types
as well as principal psychoses to be designated; 7. Race
of first admissions classified with reference to principal
psychoses; 8. Age of first admissions classified with reference
to principal psychoses; 9. Degree of education of
first admissions classified with reference to principal psychoses;
10. Environment of first admissions classified
with reference to principal psychoses; 11. Economic condition
of first admissions classified with reference to
principal psychoses; 12. Use of alcohol by first admissions
classified with reference to principal psychoses;
13. Marital condition of first admissions classified with
reference to principal psychoses; 14. Psychoses of readmissions,
types as well as principal psychoses to be
designated; 15. Discharges of patients classified with
reference to principal psychoses and condition on discharge;
16. Causes of death of patients classified with
reference to principal psychoses; 17. Age of patients at
time of death classified with reference to principal psychoses;
18. Duration of hospital life of patients dying
in hospital, classified with reference to principal psychoses.</p>

<p>An elaborate statistical manual fully explaining the
use of these tables has been furnished to the psychiatric
hospitals of the country by the Association. Since this
work has been undertaken the full cooperation of the institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the following states has been assured: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin and Wyoming, and the District of Columbia.
Practically every state hospital in the United
States is now officially represented in this important
movement. The success of this undertaking has been
largely due to the active cooperation of the National
Committee for Mental Hygiene through its Bureau of
Statistics. It should receive the enthusiastic support of
all who are interested in the future progress of modern
psychiatry.</p>

<span class="st">THE CLASSIFICATION OF MENTAL DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When the American Psychiatric Association first approached
the problem of formulating a definite scheme
for the collection of statistical data relating to mental diseases
it was immediately confronted with the necessity
of adopting an official classification of psychoses purely
for purposes of uniformity. This undertaking, which
suggested no difficulties at the outset, led to all kinds
of unexpected complications and embarrassments. Classifications
of "insanity" are almost as old as the terms
mania and melancholia and have been given a grossly
exaggerated importance by the space which for so many
years has been devoted to a consideration of this subject
in textbooks. This, if nothing else, appears to have
been demonstrated quite clearly by the discussions of
the last few years.</p>

<p>A review of the literature of psychiatry shows that
attempts to classify the psychoses date back almost to
the beginning of medical history. Hippocrates is said to
have recognized three forms of mental disorders&mdash;mania,
melancholia and dementia, although there is some question
as to his having used those terms in accordance with
their present significance. Celsus<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> also described three
forms of insanity. The first, which was accompanied by
febrile symptoms, he termed phrenitis. The second was
characterized by sadness and caused by black bile. The
third was accompanied in some cases by false images,
while in others the whole mind or judgment was impaired.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
The Roman law divided the dementes or mad into two
classes, the excited or violent (furiosi) and those deficient
in intellect (menti capti). Aretaeus<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> discussed
mania, melancholia and dementia, apparently regarding
them as all manifestations of some one disease process.
Melancholia, he said, "does not affect all the faculties
of the mind; the patients are sad and dismayed; they
are without fever." He described it as only an initial
stage of mania. Caelius Aurelianus<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> did not regard
melancholia as a form of insanity, "from which disease
it differs in that the stomach chiefly suffers, while in
Madness it is the head." Galen in his writings referred
to amentia or dementia, imbecility, mania and melancholia.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century Felix Plater<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> devised the
following classification: 1. Mentis imbecillitas: Hebetudo,
tarditus, oblivio, imprudentia. 2. Mentis consternatio:
Somnus immodicus, carus, lethargus, apoplexia,
epilepsia, convulsio, catalepsis, ecstasis. 3. Mentis alienatio:
Stultitas, temulentia, amor, melancholia, hypochondriacus
morbus, mania, hydrophobia, phrenitis, saltus
viti. 4. Mentis defatigatio: Vigiles, insomnia.
Linnaeus<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> in 1763 called his fifth class of diseases Mentales,
divided into three orders: Ideales, Imaginarii and
Pathetici. Sauvages in the same year included Hallucinationes,
Morositates and Deliria under the heading of
Vesaniae in his "Nosologia Methodica." Vogel<a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> in
1764 divided Paranoiae into mania, melancholia, and
amentia. Cullen in 1772 included insanity or the Vesaniae
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in the neuroses, divided into four groups&mdash;Amentia, Melancholia,
Mania and Oneirodinia. He described eight
varieties of melancholia and three of mania. Oneirodinia
included somnambulism and nightmare. According to
Jelliffe, Plocquet described six varieties of delirium in
his treatise on paranoia in 1772. Pinel in 1791 limited
himself to four classes of insanity&mdash;mania, melancholia,
dementia and idiotism. He looked upon melancholia as
a delirium exclusively directed upon one object or series
of objects and accompanied by sadness. Idiotism was
an advanced form of dementia. Esquirol in 1838 modified
Pinel's scheme somewhat and described Lypemania,
Monomania, Mania, Dementia and Imbecility or Idiocy.
The active discussion of classifications of various kinds
led Pritchard<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> to make the following interesting comment
in 1822: "I cannot conceive anything more preposterously
absurd than the attempt to classify diseases
with all the divisions and technology of a botanical or
zoological system, and to force what is essentially disorder
and confusion to assume the appearance of that
order and symmetry which nature displays in the arrangement
of the organized world. An aetiological classification
is the only mode of terminology and arrangement
that can be of any practical advantage, and that
is all that we have to consult." He nevertheless published
a classification of his own which was essentially
psychological in principle, although containing nothing
new.</p>

<p>The German school of this time was exceedingly
prolific in the production of classifications, as will be
shown by the following interesting and elaborate scheme
of Flemming's<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> published in 1844:&mdash;</p>

      <p class="pr3">2. Mania continua&mdash;chronic mania</p>
      <p class="pr3">3. Mania remittens&mdash;remittent mania</p>

      <p class="pr3">1. Mania adstricta seu instinctiva&mdash;partial or limited
          mania. (Mania sine delirio of Pinel.) (Moral
          insanity, monomania.)</p>
      <p class="pr3">2. Mania sparsa&mdash;general mania.</p>

<p class="p2">This is said to have been based on Jacobi's somato-aetiological
theory (1830) that "there is no disease of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
mind existing as such, but that insanity exists solely as
the consequence of disease, either functional or organic,
in some parts of the body system." Heinroth<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> saw in
the various mental disorders a disturbance of one or
the other of the normal functions of the mind which he
divided into three classes. "If the cause of derangement
is in relation to one of these manifestations of mental
existence&mdash;and to one or another it must belong, since
the mind is ever occupied with phenomena related to
one out of the three classes&mdash;we have only to inquire to
which modification the disorder actually refers itself, or
whether it affects the feelings, the understanding, or
the will. Since one of these has possession of our consciousness,
or is at least predominant at every point
of time, whichever function of the mind happens to be
that which is falling into disorder, by it the form of
insanity is determined." Griesinger<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> in 1845, on the
other hand, was of the opinion that all classifications
must in the end return to the principal forms previously
described&mdash;mania, melancholia and dementia. In 1860
Morel announced his well-known classification: Hereditary
Insanity, which included imbecility and idiocy; Toxic
Insanity (alcohol, lead, mercury, etc., as well as cretinism);
Insanity produced by the transformation of other
diseases (hysterical, epileptic, hypochondriacal); Idiopathic
Insanity (general paresis, etc.); Sympathetic Insanity,
and Dementia, "a terminative state."</p>

<p>Maudsley spoke of Affective or Pathetic, and Ideational
Insanity. The former was divided into maniacal
perversion, melancholic depression and moral alienation.
The latter included general forms (mania or melancholia),
partial forms (monomania or melancholia),
dementia (primary and secondary), general paralysis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and imbecility. Régis described five forms of mania, five
of melancholia, two of insanity of double form, and a
systematized progressive insanity. In addition to these,
he divided constitutional insanity into two groups&mdash;the
degeneracy of evolution and the degeneracy of involution.
Krafft-Ebing<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> included melancholia, mania, primary
dementia, exhaustion psychoses and terminal conditions
in his group of psychoneuroses. Under the heading of
degenerative forms he described constitutional affective
insanity, paranoia and periodical insanity. Neurasthenic,
epileptic, hysterical and hypochondriacal psychoses
were grouped together under the constitutional
neuroses. In addition to this he described chronic intoxications,
organic brain diseases and arrested development.
At a meeting of the International Congress of Alienists
in 1889 the following classification was adopted: 1.
Mania; 2. Melancholia; 3. Periodical Insanity; 4. Progressive
Systematical Insanity; 5. Dementia; 6. Organic
and Senile Dementia; 7. General Paralysis; 8. Insane
Neurosis (hysteria, epilepsy, hypochondriasis, etc.); 9.
Toxic Insanity; 10. Moral and Impulsive Insanity; and
11. Idiocy. Ziehen<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> had a classification scheme which
represented an advance in some respects. Mania and
melancholia were described as affective psychoses, and
paranoia as an intellectual disorder. He also referred
to mixed or combined forms. Imbecility, general paresis,
terminal deteriorations, etc., were grouped together
under the general heading of psychoses with intellectual
defects.</p>

<p>The British Medico-Psychological Association has
had an official classification for many years. This was

<p class="pr0">17. Defective Mental Development (oligophrenia)</p>

<p class="p2">At the annual meeting of the American Medico-Psychological
Association in 1869 Nichols called attention
to the statistical studies proposed by the International
Congress of Alienists in 1867. As a result of his efforts
a series of twenty-one statistical tables was prepared
and used unofficially for several years, although never
formally adopted. A committee reported again on this
subject in 1896, but without any definite action being
taken. The Italian psychiatrists have had a classification
which has been in general use by them for some time.
Interest in this subject has been stimulated by the frequent
publications of Kraepelin during the last thirty
years. Meyer and Hoch have been largely responsible
for bringing his work to the attention of the profession
in this country, and Kraepelin's classification with some
modifications has come into very general use here. It
was not until the publication of its twenty-first annual
report in 1909 that the New York State Commission in
Lunacy adopted a modern classification of psychoses.</p>

<p>At that time there were practically as many different
forms of statistical reports in the United States as there
were hospitals. In the meanwhile almost every textbook
published during the last fifty years has announced
a new classification of mental diseases. They have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
based on etiology, pathology, symptomatology and
psychology. English, French, German, Italian and
American classifications have appeared, each representing,
as a rule, different schools of psychiatry. Kempf<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
would discard the term psychosis altogether and speak
only of neuroses as "more consistent with the integrative
functions of the nervous system." For diagnostic purposes
he proposes to separate the benign from the pernicious
processes and classify them according to their
psychological mechanisms as suppression, repression,
compensatory, regression and dissociation neuroses. The
easiest way out of all these difficulties, as Southard<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
has said, would be "to deny the existence of entities in
mental disease. There are two forms of this contention;
first, that mental disease is nothing more or less than
insanity, an entity itself, a genus with but one species,
or secondly, that all victims of mental disease are individually
to be provided with entities, that is, all examples
of mental disease are sui generis. The development of
psychiatry has killed the former contention stone dead,
but the latter contention still flourishes to an extent
among those who overstress the individual factor. And
this latter contention is bolstered up by the existence of
so many psychopathic patients of whom a diagnosis cannot
be rendered for practical or theoretical reasons.
However, there are no really consistent advocates of the
sui generis plan of classification." It is interesting to
note that he concedes ... "that the American Medico-Psychological
Association's classification, adopted as it
has been by a great number of American institutions and
by the United States Government for war purposes, is
a reasonably good classification and aware that its constituent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
elements fairly well correspond with what all
American psychiatrists agree upon."</p>

<p>Southard<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> raises the question as to how this classification
can be used for diagnostic purposes. He answers
this query by suggesting "A key to the practical
grouping of mental diseases"<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> ... "to be followed,
when necessary, like a botanical key in the search for the
classification of a plant."... "It is a key to study and
not an analytical classification with any pretence to
finality."... "The plan is not so much an excursion
into nosology as an essay in the technique of psychiatric
diagnosis for the tyro."</p>

<p>The problem presenting itself in the adoption of a
classification purely for statistical purposes was not a
question of a scientific grouping of the psychoses based
on either etiological, anatomical, pathological, clinical
or prognostic considerations. It was a question of compiling
a tabulation or list of clinical entities recognized
generally by American psychiatrists, subject to such
changes and modifications as may be necessary to make it
conform to accepted standards. As a matter of fact, no
adequate reason for a classification of mental diseases
for any other than statistical purposes has even been advanced
by the authors of our textbooks on psychiatry.
They do not contribute anything of value whatever to our
knowledge of symptomatology, diagnosis or treatment.
Practically the only point on which the writers of our
textbooks agree is that there is no one fundamental principle
upon which a satisfactory classification can be
based. It is unfortunate that tradition seems to demand
the serious consideration of a problem which many believe
admits of no solution and which would mean little
or nothing to the future of psychiatry if it were solved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
The views of the Committee on Statistics are shown by a
quotation from the report made to the Association at its
meeting in New York in 1917:&mdash;"Your Committee feels
that the first essential of a uniform system of statistics in
hospitals for the insane is a generally recognized nomenclature
of mental diseases. The present condition with
respect to the classification of mental diseases is chaotic.
Some states use no well-defined classification. In others
the classifications used are similar in many respects but
differ enough to prevent accurate comparisons. Some
states have adopted a uniform system, while others leave
the matter entirely to the individual hospitals. This condition
of affairs discredits the science of psychiatry and
reflects unfavorably upon our Association, which should
serve as a correlating and standardizing agency for the
whole country. The large task of your Committee therefore
has been the formulation of a classification which
it could unanimously recommend for adoption by the Association.
The task was accomplished only after several
prolonged conferences at which classifications now in use
in various states and countries, and the recommendations
of leading psychiatrists were considered. The classification
finally adopted is simple, comprehensive and complete;
it copies no other classification but includes the
strong features of many others; it meets the demands of
the best modern psychiatry but does not slavishly follow
any single system. In short, your Committee has endeavored
to formulate a classification that could be easily
used in every hospital for the insane in this country and
that would meet the scientific demands of the present
day."</p>

<p>Since the compilation of statistical data relating to
the various activities of the hospitals for mental diseases
in this country was definitely decided upon by the Association
at its meeting in 1913, the membership of the Committee
on Statistics has from time to time included the

<span class="st">THE TRAUMATIC PSYCHOSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Traumatic affections of the nervous system have been
recognized in a general way for centuries, although the
psychoses resulting directly from injuries have been
given very little consideration or attention in the past.
Concussion of the brain, referred to in the writings of
Hippocrates, Galen and Celsus, was first studied postmortem
in 1705 by Littré. It is now discussed in all
textbooks on surgery. Usually milder forms are described
with evidences of shock or collapse&mdash;a brief
period of unconsciousness, partial or complete, with
visual and auditory disturbances, dizziness, muscular relaxation
or temporary paralysis, respiratory symptoms,
dilated pupils, weakness of the pulse, lowered temperature,
etc. Delirium and stupor or coma are associated
with more severe injuries. If the cortex is lacerated,
twitchings or convulsions often occur. Returning consciousness
shows various reactions&mdash;headache, vomiting,
amnesia, etc., and may be succeeded by convulsions, encephalitis
or mental disturbances. DaCosta<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> says that
some cases are followed by a complete change in the personality,
forgetfulness, headache, insomnia, attacks of
depression, lassitude and vertigo with increased susceptibility
to alcohol, heat and physical exertion. Acute
surgical injuries, and compression due to growths, hemorrhages,
fractures, etc., have been exhaustively studied.
Compression has been differentiated surgically<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> by the
later appearance of a gradual unconsciousness, more definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
paralysis, usually on the side opposite the injury,
slow pulse and stertorous respirations, unequal immobile
pupils, choked disc, convulsive movements, etc. Traumatic
encephalitis and meningitis have long been recognized
but present no definitely characteristic symptoms
which distinguish them from simple inflammatory reactions.</p>

<p>One of the earliest accurate descriptions of brain injury
associated with mental symptoms was that of the
well-known "crowbar" case. It will be recalled that
while blasting in Vermont in 1848 a man by the name of
Gage had an iron bar driven through the frontal region
of his skull, making a complete recovery and living for
over twelve years after the accident. An autopsy showed
that only the prefrontal cortex was involved. A very
interesting report on his mental condition was made by
Dr. John M. Harlow:<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> "His contractors, who regarded
him as the most efficient and capable foreman in their
employ previous to his injury, considered the change
in his mind so marked that they could not give him his
place again. The equilibrium, or balance, so to speak,
between his intellectual faculties and animal propensities
seems to have been destroyed. He is fitful, irreverent,
indulging at times in the grossest profanity (which was
not previously his custom), manifesting but little deference
for his fellows, impatient of restraint or advice
when it conflicts with his desires, at times pertinaciously
obstinate yet capricious and vacillating, devising many
plans of future operations, which are no sooner arranged
than they are abandoned in turn for others appearing
more feasible. A child in his intellectual capacity and
manifestations, he had the animal passions of a strong
man. Previous to his injury, though untrained in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
schools, he possessed a well balanced mind, and was
looked upon by those who knew him as a shrewd, smart
business man, very energetic and persistent in executing
all his plans of operation. In this regard his mind was
radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances
said he was 'no longer Gage.'"</p>

<p>Various other cases reported have established the fact
that mental deterioration usually follows extensive injuries
to the frontal lobes. Witmer<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> summarizes this
as consisting of "slight intellectual degradation, moral
and emotional perversion, deficiency of attention, and
volitional inefficiency."</p>

<p>A work by Ericksen in 1866 on "Railway Injuries to
the Nervous System" and Page's book in 1882 on "Injuries
of the Spine" pointed the way to an extensive
study of the so-called traumatic neuroses. This characterization
of the functional disturbances of the nervous
system following injuries was apparently the result of a
monograph by Oppenheim on that subject in 1889. They
had previously been considered as purely organic in
origin. Traumatic hysteria was discussed very fully at
various times by Charcot, whose work is so well known
as to require no comment. In 1892 Friedmann described
a vasomotor complex due to concussion. This is accompanied
by such symptoms as headache, dizziness, loss of
capacity for both physical and mental work with an increased
fatigability, irritability, memory defects, and
changes in personality, such as sensitiveness and eccentricity
with a marked intolerance to alcohol. This condition
appears some time after the symptoms of concussion
and shock have subsided and may last for some months.
Friedmann looked upon this as purely a vasomotor disturbance.
It is probably an important factor, in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
cases at least, of "shell shock". Traumatic epilepsy may
result from foci of softening or other local areas of
injury to the brain. Neurasthenia, hysteria and other
neuroses are now generally looked upon as being essentially
functional and not organic in origin, although they
may follow a trauma. The simulation of these conditions
has led to a great deal of discussion, notwithstanding the
fact that Oppenheim found them in only about four per
cent of his cases. Köppen (1897) made a very elaborate
study of the postmortem lesions in the "traumatic neuroses".
He found that violence to the skull often resulted
in small injuries at the base of the frontal area,
at the apices of the parietal lobes or in the occipital region.
The pathological changes involved represented
localized encephalitis with hemorrhagic infiltration. Foci
of softening were often found in the cerebral cortex.
He noted coma and convulsions with only minute areas
of destruction of the basal cortex at autopsy. This would
indicate a severe irritation, probably due to circulatory
disturbances. The resulting symptoms he thought were
very likely to be confused with general paresis. In cases
of extreme dementia following traumatism he often found
no pathological lesion other than a cicatrix in the cerebral
cortex.</p>

<p>One of the most important contributions to the literature
of traumatism as associated with psychoses was
made by Adolf Meyer<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> in 1903. Notwithstanding the
statements of such observers as Savage, appearing as
late as 1905, he expressed the opinion that traumatism
and general paresis are not directly related except that
injuries may rarely act as precipitating factors. He
does not expect to find psychoses resulting from small
lacerations or other similar lesions in the cortex. As a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
result of his observations Meyer<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> described the following
forms of traumatic disorders:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p0">1. The direct post-traumatic deliria with the following subdivisions:</p>
    <p class="p7a">a. Preeminently febrile reactions;</p>
    <p class="p7a">b. The delirium nervosum of Dupuytren, not differing
    from deliria after operations, injuries,
    etc.;</p>
    <p class="p7a">c. The delirium of slow evolution of coma, with or
    without alcoholic basis;</p>
    <p class="p7a">d. Forms of protracted deliria, usually with numerous
    tabulations, etc. (with or without alcoholic
    or senile basis).</p>

<p class="p0">2. The post-traumatic constitution:</p>
    <p class="p7a">a. Types with mere facilitation of reaction to alcohol,
    grippe, etc.;</p>
    <p class="p7a">b. Types with vasomotor neurosis;</p>
    <p class="p7a">c. Types with explosive diathesis;</p>
    <p class="p7a">d. Types with hysteroid or epileptoid episodes,
    with or without convulsions (such as most reflex
    psychoses);</p>
    <p class="p7a">e. Types of paranoic development.</p>

<p class="p0">3. The traumatic defect conditions:</p>
    <p class="p7a">a. Primary defects allied to aphasia;</p>
    <p class="p7a">b. Secondary deterioration in connection with epilepsy;</p>
    <p class="p7a">c. Terminal deterioration due to progressive alterations
    of the primarily injured parts, with or
    without arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">4. Psychoses in which trauma is merely a contributing factor:</p>
    <p class="p7a">a. General paralysis, with or without traumatic
    stigmata;</p>
    <p class="p7a">b. Manic-depressive and other transitory psychoses,
    catatonic deterioration and paranoic
    conditions, with or without traumatic stigmata.</p>

<p class="p0">5. Traumatic psychoses from injury not directly affecting the head.</p>

<p class="p2">The most interesting feature perhaps of this classification
is the post-traumatic constitution. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
quotes Köppen's excellent description of this condition as
follows:&mdash;"Men who have suffered from a cranial lesion
in which there has been a severe damage of the brain, with
or without an injury to the cranial bones, on their recovery
from the immediate results complain especially of
all kinds of sensations in the head, which they describe
either as pain or as pressure with feeling of crawling
or dullness of the head, more or less definitely located at
the point where they were hit. They frequently become
dizzy, and at times even faint for a short time without
any epileptic attack. Although slight attacks of dizziness
may recur frequently, epilepsy with typical attacks need
not develop. There is further in our patients a great irritability
and nervosity. The formerly good-natured or
even-tempered persons become irascible, hard to get along
with; formerly conscientious fathers cease to care for
their family. The irritability at times increases to excessive
violence in which actions occur of which they have no
remembrance; the nervous system is not only under the
influence of psychic irritation but especially susceptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to the influence of alcohol or tobacco, in even small
quantities. The working capacity of our patients is very
poor. It suffers variously, although such individuals
often give an impression of perfect capacity; and since
the morbid symptoms are essentially subjective, they always
arouse doubts whether they could not do something
at least, even if they are unable to work in a noisy shop
or on a high scaffolding. It is, however, certain that the
patients are very forgetful; in giving orders or doing errands
they make the most incredible blunders; frequently
everything must be written down. Their capacity for
thought has suffered, as is sometimes shown, especially
in the great slowness of thought. These patients are
unable to concentrate their attention, not even in occupations
which serve for mere entertainment, such as reading
or playing cards. They like best to brood unoccupied;
even conversation is rather obnoxious. This point is so
characteristic that it gives a certain means of distinction
from simulation, which as a rule does not interfere with
taking part in the conversations and pleasures of the
ward and playing at cards, which means as a rule too
much of an effort for the brain of actual sufferers. The
patients are usually advised to take light physical work,
but even there they are perfectly useless. Excessive sensitiveness
of their head obliges them to avoid all work
which is connected with sudden jerks, bending over is
especially troublesome; and there is hardly any physical
work in which this can be avoided; the blood rushes to
the head, headache increases, dizziness sets in and the
work stops. Patients feel best when in the open air,
inactive and undisturbed. There are but few objective
signs, such as increase of pulse, flushing of the face, dermatographia,
trembling and uncertainty in the Romberg
position, such as is shown in all general nervosity. But
the complaints are so exceedingly uniform that the uniformity
of the subjective complaints justifies the conclusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that they are well founded. The picture thus is
briefly that of a mental weakness shown by easy fatigue,
slowness of thought, inability to keep impressions, irritability,
and a great number of unpleasant sensations,
before all headaches and dizziness."</p>

<p>It is exceedingly interesting to note that Schläger in
discussing disorders resulting from concussion of the
brain, in 1857, as quoted by Griesinger,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> makes the following
comment on these cases:&mdash;"Very often the character
and disposition changes; in 20 cases great irascibility,
an angry, passionate manner even to the most
violent outbursts of temper was remarked&mdash;less frequently
over-estimation of self, prodigality, restlessness,
disquietude; in 14 cases there were attempts at suicide,
frequently weakness of memory, confusion." Meyer
found, furthermore, in his analysis "all the possible degrees
of episodes of more or less dazing and dream
states; from a temporary dazed feeling to episodes of
hysteriform or epileptoid absences. Apart from the
subjective feeling of haziness, the characteristic trait is
the occurrence of complete dream interpretations and
peculiar fabrications, which color the primary traumatic
insanity as well as the subacute and episodic types, and
even the paranoic type."</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> describes concussion and compression,
traumatic delirium, traumatic epilepsy and traumatic
mental enfeeblement. He finds these conditions due to
concussion, compression or injury to the brain substance
either at the site of traumatism or at some point opposite.
There may be contusions, lacerations of the brain
tissue or hemorrhages, usually in the frontal, occipital
or parietal regions. Injuries to the cortex are not demonstrable
in all cases. The circulatory disturbances he considers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
an important factor and thinks that they account
for smaller lesions of the cerebral tissue in many instances
where no gross changes are apparent. More or less disturbance
of consciousness is to be expected in these conditions.
The patient is somewhat dull, drowsy, clumsy,
forgetful and absentminded. Memory is sometimes much
affected. In more severe cases there is a complete loss
of consciousness which may last a few minutes only or be
a matter of hours or days. On waking, the patient is
bewildered and confused, with a marked disturbance of
apprehension. Perception is involved as in the recognition
of complicated pictures or the understanding of long
and detailed statements. A clear comprehension of
events and surroundings is lacking. The patients may
know that they are in a hospital without knowing what
hospital it is or why they are there and are unable to
recognize persons around them. Occasionally hallucinations
of sight or of hearing occur. At times delusional
ideas are expressed, usually of a depressive type. They
have no realization whatever of their own condition. The
memory disturbance may take the form of a Korsakow's
complex. Memory gaps appear sometimes for events
just before the accident and in other cases cover long
periods of time. While as a rule events of the remote
past are retained, recent impressions are quickly lost.
They cannot repeat what is read to them, do not remember
the names of persons about them, and sometimes show
evidence of falsification of memory with fabrication. All
idea as to time is usually lost. Mental reactions become
noticeably difficult. The patient is distractible, cannot
count accurately, has difficulty in repeating dates and
numbers and forms no correct judgment as to his own
personal affairs. Many express themselves, however, on
the other hand, with great facility and readiness. Some
show considerable fatigability. The mood is often elated
with a tendency to facetiousness, although frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
tearful and anxious, particularly at night. Irritable,
faultfinding trends usually appear later. As a rule they
are talkative, restless, sensitive, abusive or even insolent.
Bonhöffer has reported stereotypies as well as stuporous
and other catatonic types. In speech the patients often
become incoherent, make mistakes, forget words or coin
new ones. Similar mistakes appear in reading and writing.
Asymbolism and parapraxia are observed. Residual
symptoms of the brain injury are headaches, dizziness,
fainting attacks and convulsions. The pupils are
contracted and do not react properly to light. The pulse
is frequently very slow.</p>

<p>In fractures at the base of the brain there is likely
to be a hemorrhage from the ears and deafness from injuries
to the labyrinth. Involvement of the pyramidal
tracts may cause unilateral weakness or even paralysis,
with increased knee-jerks and occasionally a Babinski
reflex. Usually the mental symptoms appear promptly
after the injury. Sometimes, however, there is for a
while only a slight dulness. The patients are unable to
go about the house unassisted, and act peculiarly, becoming
clouded or delirious after a few hours or days. Improvement
begins to show itself in a few weeks as a
rule unless some intercurrent affection intervenes, but
the symptoms may persist for several months. Meningitis
or abscess formation often causes death. These
developments are usually indicated by a marked delirium
or coma. There may also be paralysis, convulsions, disturbances
of speech, rise of temperature, etc. The subsidence
of active delirious symptoms is sometimes succeeded
by Kraepelin's traumatic neurosis. Following
the traumatic delirium or concussion psychosis described,
mental enfeeblement sometimes appears. Clouding of
consciousness is not a factor in this condition. There is
usually a complete change in the psychic personality.
The patients tire easily, are incapable of sustained mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
efforts, forgetful, absentminded, complain of dizziness,
dulness, noises in the ears, pressure in the head, migraine,
palpitation, etc. Or they may be irritable, with outbursts
of anger often alternating with apathy. Some are depressed,
anxious or hypochondriacal. There is a greatly
increased susceptibility to alcohol and intoxication often
induces excitements, epileptiform attacks, stupors or
rarely actual dreamstates.</p>

<p>Wildermuth found a history of traumatism in 3.8 per
cent of his cases of epilepsy. The statistics of the German
Army show 4.2 per cent. When the convulsive manifestations
are in the foreground and the picture is one
of traumatic epilepsy, advanced mental deterioration
may be exhibited, with impairment of mental capacity
and disturbance of memory. These cases remain apathetic,
forgetful, dull, irritable and childish. At autopsy
there are often no evidences of any great injury to the
brain. Occasionally extensive areas of softening may,
however, be found. Usually there is a widespread destruction
of the nerve cells and their associated fibres.
There is often a proliferation of the glia, with changes
in the vessel walls which may be thickened and dilated,
with capillary hemorrhages and softenings. Extensive
areas of the cortex may be involved. Bleuler's description
of the traumatic psychoses is not essentially different
from that of Kraepelin.</p>

<p>The differentiation of these conditions as suggested
in the statistical manual of the American Psychiatric
Association is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The diagnosis should be restricted to mental disorders
arising as a direct or obvious consequence of a
brain (or head) injury producing psychotic symptoms
of a fairly characteristic kind. The amount of damage
to the brain may vary from an extensive destruction of
tissue to simple concussion or physical shock with or
without fracture of the skull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Manic-depressive psychoses, general paralysis, dementia
praecox, and other mental disorders in which
trauma may act as a contributory or precipitating cause,
should not be included in this group.</p>

<p>"The following are the most common clinical types
of traumatic psychosis and should be specified in the
statistical record of the hospital:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(a) Traumatic delirium: This may take the form
of an acute delirium (concussion delirium), or a more
protracted delirium resembling the Korsakow mental
complex.</p>

<p>"(b) Traumatic constitution: Characterized by a
gradual post-traumatic change in disposition with vasomotor
instability, headaches, fatigability, irritability or
explosive emotional reactions; usually hyper-sensitiveness
to alcohol, and in some cases development of paranoid,
hysteroid, or epileptoid symptoms.</p>

<p>"(c) Post-traumatic mental enfeeblement (dementia):
Varying degrees of mental reduction with or without
aphasic symptoms, epileptiform attacks or development
of a cerebral arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p>"(d) Other types."</p>

<p class="p2b">We have not as yet, unfortunately, sufficient data at
our disposal to warrant intelligent conclusions as to the
frequency of the various forms of traumatic psychoses.
One hundred and twenty-seven cases reported from the
New York state hospitals during a period of six years
were classified as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">Undoubtedly with a more definite understanding as to
the delimitation of these different conditions more complete
information will be available later. We are nevertheless
justified in feeling that the frequency of the traumatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
psychoses considered as a group can be determined
with a fair degree of accuracy. Of 49,640 first admissions
to the New York hospitals during a period of eight years,
161, or .32 per cent, were definitely ascribed to traumatism.
Twenty-one other hospitals in fourteen different
states reported forty-five cases of traumatic psychoses
(.24 per cent) in 18,336 admissions. Two hundred and
seventeen cases (.3 per cent) have therefore been reported
in a total of 70,987 first admissions to forty-eight
state hospitals for mental diseases in this country.</p>

<span class="st">THE SENILE PSYCHOSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Never until very recently has any great importance
been attached to the psychoses due solely to age or much
interest manifested in them. These forms of insanity in
the majority of our textbooks have appeared only under
the designation of senile dementia. This is true of
the earlier editions of Krafft-Ebing and many other
writers. Clouston referred to senile dementia as one of
four varieties of mental enfeeblement. "Most cases,"<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
he says, "fall under three varieties. The first has as
its chief characteristics depression and lethargy. The
second consists chiefly of excitement, sometimes with a
certain exaltation, but always with irritability, restlessness,
unreason, suspicion, and change of affection. The
third variety consists chiefly of the abolition of mind
in all its forms, or senile dementia, and of complete
dotage. In some cases those three varieties form three
different stages in the same case. In others they do
not change." Régis, in a work on mental medicine covering
668 pages in all, devoted two and one-half pages to
a consideration of the insanity of old age. Ziehen<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> in
1894 included "dementia senilis" with general paralysis,
epileptic, alcoholic and terminal deteriorations in his
group of "acquired defect psychoses" and characterized
it as "a chronic organic psychosis of advanced years, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
principal symptom of which is a progressive intelligence
defect." Excitements, depressions, confusional states,
deliria, deteriorations, mental mechanisms of any and
all kinds, occurring late in life, were usually disposed
of without any effort at differentiation by the very convenient
method of relegating them to the obscure domain
of senile dementia. This is a field which on exploration
has been found to be one of considerable interest. It has
been pointed out that manic-depressive insanity not infrequently
occurs in persons of advanced age. Uncomplicated
alcoholic psychoses are not at all rare. Bleuler has
advanced the theory that dementia praecox and certain
of the senile conditions are similar if not identical processes.
General paresis has been demonstrated in the
later periods of life by modern laboratory methods and
the diagnosis confirmed at autopsy. Cerebral syphilis
certainly cannot be left out of consideration. Toxic deliria
are encountered now and then. Even the psychoneuroses
are possibilities.</p>

<p>Kraepelin first established the importance of involution
melancholia as a form of depression warranting
separate consideration. The anxiety psychoses occurring
late in life have since been made the subject of exhaustive
study by various observers. It was discovered that many
of the mental disturbances of the aged could be attributed
directly to arteriosclerosis alone. Korsakow's syndrome
has been found to be as frequently due to senility as it
is to alcoholism. Some of our more modern works on
psychiatry have included very elaborate chapters on
purely "presenile" conditions. Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> in his last
edition devotes twenty pages to a review of this subject.</p>

<p>He divides the presenile psychoses into melancholia,
anxieties, late katatonia, depressive delusional conditions,
anxious delusional types terminating in advanced
deterioration, depressive states with deterioration, excitements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and paranoid forms. The development of
Kraepelin's conception of melancholia has been fully discussed
in another chapter. He speaks also of the occasional
occurrence of anxious conditions in late life
with excitements or an exalted mood with grandiose ideas
or even paranoid manifestations. These may present a
catatonic picture with more or less inaccessibility, stereotypies,
peculiar attitudes and movements, absurd resistance,
impulsiveness, desultoriness and disconnected
speech. Our knowledge as to the exact causation and
nature of katatonia still being far from complete, he
knows of no reason why a process of that kind should
not be recognized as one of the presenile conditions.
Thalbitzer suggested the name, depressive delusional insanity
(depressiven Wahnsinn), for the conditions exhibiting
numerous delusions and active hallucinations with
an emotional reaction "determined by the course of the
disease." Rehm also described a similar form associated
with arteriosclerotic changes and characterized by hallucinations
of hearing, together with mannerisms and
sterotypies.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> describes first a group of presenile cases
showing the development of depressive ideas and anxious
states with a progressive mental enfeeblement. Delusions
of self-accusation and persecution present themselves
early in the course of the disease. Symptoms of
a more decidedly hypochondriacal type may occur later.
Hallucinations and somatic delusions also develop, often
with nihilistic trends. Everyone is dead, the patient is
the only one left in the world, has no legs, cannot go out
of the house, has entirely disappeared, does not exist
any more, etc. The consciousness is usually fairly clear,
orientation is well preserved and there is no marked disturbance
of thought. Anxious excitement is often an important
feature. The termination is in mental enfeeblement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
invariably. This condition manifests itself usually
at about the fortieth year. He is of the opinion that this
symptom complex cannot be considered either as belonging
to manic-depressive insanity or attributable to
arteriosclerosis, nor is it catatonic in its origin.</p>

<p>He finds another group of cases occurring in women
between forty-five and fifty years of age, characterized
pathologically by striking anatomical changes and clinically
by a very unfavorable course. A depression first
appears, followed by anxiety with thoughts of suicide.
Hallucinations do not occur as a rule. Restless and agitated
excitement is a prominent symptom leading finally
to confusion, clouding of consciousness, and disorientation.
This is followed by a condition of mental enfeeblement
terminating in early death. Well-defined postmortem
changes have been found, such as the "grave alteration"
described by Nissl, proliferation of the glia, swelling
of the protoplasmic bodies with cell enclosures, etc.,
but no fibril formation. Large quantities of lipoid material
are found in the surrounding vessels and in the
vascular sheaths. This condition, also observed by
Nitsche and Döblin, Kraepelin looks upon as probably
a presenile process of autotoxic origin, there being no
other cause demonstrable. He does not consider this disease
process as being related to "late katatonia," genuine
katatonia or manic-depressive insanity.</p>

<p>He would also separate out another smaller group as
probably belonging to the presenile forms&mdash;cases with
excitements of long duration, terminating in a marked
deterioration. This condition is likely to be of sudden
onset, with depressive ideas of self-accusation, later
showing an active restlessness. These patients soon become
clouded and confused, often with grandiose ideas
suggesting general paresis. They may show memory
falsifications. Stuporous states occasionally intervene,
followed by an active excitement. Echolalia is common.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
The excitement may last for months or even for a year
or more and often stops suddenly, always with deterioration
later. In the cases which have come to autopsy Alzheimer
has reported severe and widespread cell alterations,
fibre loss, glia reactions, and changes in the vessel
walls, somewhat suggesting the pathological findings in
general paresis. The cases in this group usually have
been of the male sex between sixty and seventy years of
age. Kraepelin speaks of the clinical picture as a mixture
of the symptoms of general paresis, katatonia and
manic-depressive psychoses and it is usually diagnosed
as one or the other of these conditions.</p>

<p>The paranoid presenile forms occur usually in women.
Consciousness is clear, although there may be a mild
anxiety or hypochondriasis. The persecutory ideas are
variable and changeable. Delusions of jealousy are common
although hallucinations are infrequent. Memory
is often somewhat impaired and retrospective falsifications
are occasionally observed. The mood is as a rule
anxious and suspicious. Suicidal tendencies often appear.
Restlessness, excitement, impulsive actions and
outbursts of anger are noted at times. Rarely a more
cheerful mood develops. The disease may become stationary
and show no marked changes for years.</p>

<p>Kraepelin himself seems to be very uncertain as to
the significance and the delimitation of these various presenile
forms. It must be confessed that some of the types
described very strongly suggest the condition formerly
looked upon by him as involutional melancholia. It will
be noted that he considers as possible etiological factors
the disturbance of metabolism which may result from regressive
or involutional processes. The differentiation
from manic-depressive forms, from arteriosclerotic disorders
and from senile psychoses must also be looked
upon as presenting some difficulties which cannot be entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
disregarded. Many possibilities suggest themselves.</p>

<p>In the senile deteriorations Kraepelin notes particularly
a loss in the capacity of apprehension and perception,
with a sluggishness of the train of thought, a dulling
of the emotions, a reduction of energy and the development
of conduct disorders. Ranschburg in psychological
tests noticed a lengthening of the reaction time, with a
delay in the choice of action, the reading of words, the
performance of addition, and the formation of judgment.
The retardation was shown particularly in psychic processes
and the association time. The reactions were, moreover,
much more monotonous, irregular and unreliable
than in the young. Memory tests also showed poor associations.</p>

<p>The most advanced form Kraepelin describes as senile
dementia, a progressive mental enfeeblement in which
the loss of apprehension and memory becomes a conspicuous
feature. The perception of external impressions is
diminished and delayed and there is a profound disorder
of attention. Memory of the remote past is much better
than it is for current events. Retrospective falsification
is a common symptom. The patient is, moreover, unable
to change old viewpoints or acquire new ones. Delusional
manifestations such as childish egotism, foolish suspicions
or notions of impending illness develop. Grandiose
ideas often occur, delusions of great wealth being
common. These symptoms are transitory and come and
go without apparent reason. In some cases the hallucinations
resemble those found in the alcoholic psychoses.
Sooner or later there is a disturbance of consciousness
leading to a dreamlike existence suggesting a delirium.
There is a noticeable dulling of the emotional feelings.
The patients become indifferent and apathetic, losing interest
in their surroundings, and are often irritable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
excitable. In a certain number of cases depressive states
develop, sometimes with suicidal tendencies. The delusions
may be hypochondriacal or nihilistic in character.
Complaints of persecution are common. Some of the
patients show a simple, childish deterioration with seclusive
tendencies. Stuporous or cataleptic states may
develop. Others become uneasy, wander in the streets,
remove their clothes, collect rubbish, or show sexual excitement.
Restlessness at night is especially suggestive.</p>

<p>Delirious excited states ("Senile Delirium") characterized
a certain number of Kraepelin's cases. In these,
clouding of consciousness is marked. The presbyophrenic
complex described by Kahlbaum often occurs.
These cases are fairly clear mentally at first, as far as
their surroundings are concerned, but show memory disturbances,
particularly for recent events. Orientation is
lost very soon and they fail to recognize old friends and
relatives. Fabrications are resorted to for the purpose
of remedying these defects of memory and delusions are
very common. Nevertheless, judgment about many
things is well retained. In some instances, however, orientation
for time, place and person is completely lost.
Kraepelin is in doubt as to whether presbyophrenia
should be looked upon as constituting a definite entity or
only a form of senile insanity. It may last for years or
terminate in a marked deterioration. In some of the
senile cases arteriosclerotic changes in the cortex are
very pronounced. This is more noticeable in the depressive
and anxious forms and in the incoherent varieties.
These individuals become clouded, incoherent, and deteriorate
rapidly.</p>

<p>There is also a characteristic paranoid form of senile
psychosis. Delusions of suspicion and jealousy are common
in these cases. They usually develop persecutory
trends and often exhibit hallucinations of hearing. They
sometimes show partial disorientation and gaps in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
memory. The mood is usually irritable and often anxious.
There is very likely to be a disturbance of sleep
and often signs of physical enfeeblement. There may be
neurological symptoms caused by the arteriosclerotic
complications, such as headache, pupillary changes,
tremors of the tongue and disturbance of the reflexes.
Tremors are also shown in the writing. Paraphasia occurs
and there may be sensory aphasia or apraxia.</p>

<p>In severe cases of senile dementia Kraepelin expects
to find definite lesions at autopsy. The brain weight is
always decreased, sometimes to a very striking degree.
The volume of the brain is reduced and the ventricles enlarged.
The cortex is diminished in thickness, the frontal
region being most affected. The parietal region may be
involved, but not to any such extent as in general paresis.
There may be localized areas of atrophy. Pachymeningitis
and hemorrhagic membranes are often found. The
microscope shows a proliferation of the glia cells and
there is often some disturbance of the layering of the
cortex. Cell alterations appear, with fatty degeneration,
some neurones showing little more than a darkly colored
nucleus. The glia cells are enlarged. There should be
no marked changes in the vessels. Fatty changes in the
ganglion cells are very noticeable. There is also some
loss in the tangential fibres.</p>

<p>Quite characteristic of the senile brain is the occurrence
of the miliary plaques or "drusen" described by
Redlich in 1898. Fischer in 1907 reached the conclusion
that these "drusen" were pathognomonic of presbyophrenia,
as he did not find them in senile dementia, in
other psychoses or in normal brains. Hübner, however,
noted them in alcoholics and "circular" cases as well as
in normal individuals. Oppenheim also found them in
the brains of the aged when no psychoses were observed.
The interior of the plaque is a homogeneous, dark-staining,
structureless mass. Sometimes there is a clear space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
around this center, with club- or spindle-shaped bodies
in the periphery, representing remnants probably of
neurones, glia cells or axis cylinders. The whole structure
is encapsulated in glia fibres. These so-called
plaques were spoken of by Fischer as "miliare Nekrosen"
and by Redlich as "miliare Sclerosen." Kraepelin is
of the opinion that they are associated either with senile
cases showing arteriosclerotic changes or presbyophrenia.
Alzheimer has described a senile atrophy of
the brain with wedgeshaped areas showing cell loss.
This is due to a gradual occlusion of the smaller vessels
extending down from the meninges into the cortex, and
may result in a hemorrhage, a softening or merely an
atrophic area characterized by an absence of ganglion
cells. He has also described another group of cases showing
characteristic cell changes.</p>

<p>This condition has been given the name "Alzheimer's
disease" by Kraepelin.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It is marked clinically by a
gradual senile deterioration with organic brain changes.
These eases show some thought defect, loss of memory,
confusion, and clouding. Later they become restless,
talkative, sing and laugh, etc. Aphasic disturbances develop
early, with paraphasia or apraxia. There are
speech disturbances ending in a senseless jargon and
writing becomes impossible. An advanced deterioration
ensues. Physically there is a general weakness and uncertain
gait, sometimes with epileptiform attacks. The
pupillary reaction may be lost and evidences of arteriosclerosis
usually appear. The disease may last for many
years. At autopsy "drusen" are common in the cortex
and almost a third of the nerve cells are found to be destroyed.
These are replaced by darkly-staining fibril
bundles. There is marked neuroglia reaction, particularly
around the "drusen" and retrogressive changes
are found in the vessel walls. This disease usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
appears about the fortieth year and may be looked upon,
Kraepelin says, as a "senium praecox," although its
significance is not clear.</p>

<p>He finds the senile psychoses occurring usually between
the ages of sixty-five and eighty, although they
occasionally appear before sixty. Seven and sixty-seven
hundredths per cent of his cases were between sixty and
sixty-five years of age; ten per cent between sixty-five
and seventy; thirty-five per cent between seventy and
seventy-five; 27.8 per cent between seventy-five and
eighty; 22.2 per cent between eighty and eighty-five;
10.5 per cent between eighty-five and ninety; and 2.78
per cent were over ninety years of age. Of 183 cases
studied, twenty-three per cent were cases of presbyophrenia;
sixty-three per cent of simple deterioration;
eight per cent of arteriosclerotic origin; and the remainder,
of delusional forms. More than half of the
cases of presbyophrenia occurred in persons over
seventy-five. The paranoid and arteriosclerotic forms
occurred in younger individuals. In the alcoholic cases
the Korsakow complex was common. The analysis of
presenile psychoses made by Kraepelin is, to say the
least, exceedingly interesting. Such clear-cut differentiations
as he describes are, however, not always possible or
necessary. Very few other writers have gone into the
question so exhaustively, nor is his classification of these
conditions generally accepted. Bleuler<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> in 1918 in discussing
the presenile psychoses quotes Kraepelin's classification
and also refers to Gaupp's anxious depressive
forms. Under the senile deteriorations he describes "dementia
senilis" and presbyophrenia. He also calls attention
to the fact that Binswanger spoke of a "pre-senile
dementia" occurring between the fortieth and fiftieth
years of age and characterized by an emotional dulness
and a diminished capacity for work. Bleuler speaks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the affective disturbances in advanced years as senile
mania and melancholia, which he says may recover, the
former frequently, the latter more rarely.</p>

<p>The American Psychiatric Association has only attempted
to cover the principal groupings of the characteristic
senile forms. The differentiation of these conditions
as suggested in the statistical manual is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A well defined type of psychosis which as a rule
develops gradually and is characterized by the following
symptoms: Impairment of retention (forgetfulness) and
general failure of memory more marked for recent experiences;
defects in orientation and a general reduction
of mental capacity; the attention, concentration and
thinking processes are interfered with; there is self-centering
of interests, often irritability and stubborn opposition;
a tendency to reminiscences and fabrications.
Accompanying this deterioration there may occur paranoid
trends, depressions, confused states, etc. Certain
clinical types should therefore be specified, but these
often overlap:</p>

<p>"(a) Simple deterioration: Retention and memory
defects, reduction in intellectual capacity and narrowing
of interests; usually also suspiciousness, irritability and
restlessness, the latter particularly at night.</p>

<p>"(b) Presbyophrenic type: Severe memory and retention
defects with complete disorientation; but at the
same time preservation of mental alertness and attentiveness
with ability to grasp immediate impressions and conversation
quite well. Forgetfulness leads to absurd contradictions
and repetitions; suggestibility and free fabrication
are prominent symptoms. (The general picture
resembles the Korsakow mental complex.)</p>

<p>"(c) Delirious and confused types: Often in the early
stages of the psychoses and for a long period the picture
is one of deep confusion or of a delirious condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
"(d) Depressed and agitated types: In addition to
the underlying deterioration there may be a pronounced
depression and persistent agitation.</p>

<p>"(e) Paranoid types: Well marked delusional
trends, chiefly persecutory or expansive ideas, often accompany
the deterioration and in the early stages may
make the diagnosis difficult if the defect symptoms are
mild.</p>

<p>"(f) Pre-senile types: The so-called 'Alzheimer's
disease.' An early senile deterioration which usually
leads rapidly to a deep dementia. Reported to occur
as early as the fortieth year. Most cases show an irritable
or anxious depressive mood with aphasic or apractic
symptoms. There is apt to be general resistiveness
and sometimes spasticity.</p>

<p>"(g) Other types."</p>

<p>The frequency of senile cases is shown by the fact
that of 84,143 admissions to the New York hospitals during
a period of sixteen years, 12,017, or 14.2 per cent,
were over sixty years of age, while 8.4 per cent were
between sixty and seventy years old, and 4.5 per cent
between seventy and eighty. Of 49,640 first admissions
to the New York state hospitals during eight years
4,724 cases, or 9.52 per cent, were diagnosed as senile
psychoses. They constituted 9.63 per cent of the admissions
in Massachusetts during 1919 and 10.61 per
cent of the 18,336 admissions to twenty-one hospitals in
fourteen other states. Of 70,987 admissions to all of the
institutions referred to, 6,961, or 9.8 per cent, were senile
psychoses.</p>

<p class="p2b">During a period of eight years in the New York state
hospitals, when the present classification was not adhered
to absolutely, 4,724 senile psychoses were divided
into types as follows:&mdash;Simple deterioration, 52.01 per
cent; presbyophrenia, 5.75 per cent; delirious and confused
states, 12.99 per cent; depressed and agitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
forms, 8.25 per cent; and paranoid varieties, 16.23 per
cent. During the same period less than one per cent of
presenile psychoses were reported. Since the Association's
classification has been in use the same institutions
show the following distribution of 1,351 senile psychoses
during 1918 and 1919:&mdash;Simple deterioration, 56.24 per
cent; presbyophrenia, 4.14 per cent; delirious and confused
states, 13.53 per cent; depressed and agitated
forms, 18.65 per cent; and paranoid varieties and presenile
forms, less than one per cent. The senile psychoses
in the Massachusetts hospitals during 1919 were
divided as follows:&mdash;Simple deterioration, 56.94 per
cent; presbyophrenia, 7.79 per cent; delirious and confused
states, 7.45 per cent; depressed and agitated forms,
7.11 per cent; paranoid conditions, 18.64 per cent; and
presenile forms, 2.03 per cent. In nineteen hospitals in
other states 1,823 cases were classified as follows:&mdash;Simple
deterioration, 64.39 per cent; presbyophrenia,
11.62 per cent; delirious and confused states, 9.59 per
cent; depressed and agitated forms, 4.71 per cent; paranoid
conditions, 6.91 per cent; and presenile forms, .27
per cent. The total of 6,842 cases referred to above were,
therefore, distributed as to type as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p2">These constituted in all 14.4 per cent of the 2,895 first
admissions during the year, a much higher rate than
that shown in other states. In analyzing these findings
it should be borne in mind that the American classifications
do not take into consideration presenile conditions
as such, they being all reported with the senile psychoses,
with the exception of involutional melancholia, which is,
of course, shown separately.</p>

<p>Southard<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> has called attention to the margin of error
in the diagnosis of senile psychoses. Forty-two cases
unanimously diagnosed as "senile dementia" were "reviewed
clinically and anatomically, with a surprisingly
low general percentage of accuracy (sixty-six per cent)
where either cerebral atrophy or cortical arteriosclerosis
or both were regarded as confirmatory, and with still
lower percentages: (48 per cent) where cortical arteriosclerosis
was considered essential and (38 per cent) where
cerebral atrophy was considered essential for a correct
diagnosis." It is significant that exactly one-third of the
cases studied were found by Southard to more properly
"belong in a group of acute psychoses or other mental
diseases occurring in old age but not dependent on recognizable
senile changes."</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH CEREBRAL
ARTERIOSCLEROSIS</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Sufficient weight has not been attached heretofore
to the important influence of cerebral arteriosclerosis in
the production of mental diseases. Unquestionably it
has been a complicating factor in many of the generally
recognized psychoses which has not been given adequate
consideration. Its relation to involution melancholia as
well as the presenile and senile disorders has been given
a great deal of attention, but cannot as yet be clearly
defined. Only in its syphilitic forms can it be looked
upon as contributing to the clinical picture in general
paresis. It is, however, productive of late deterioration
in the chronic alcoholic conditions and in the manic-depressive
psychoses occurring in advanced years. It plays a
part frequently in the terminal stages of dementia
praecox. In paranoia and the paranoid conditions
of long standing it often becomes a factor to be reckoned
with. Certainly in the differentiation of the epilepsies of
the aged it must be taken into definite account.</p>

<p>The importance of arteriosclerosis, a term used first
by Lobstein some seventy-five years ago, has long been
recognized. Osler in referring to this subject made the
following interesting comment:&mdash;"To a majority of men
death comes primarily or secondarily through this portal.
The onset of what may be called physiological arteriosclerosis
depends, in the first place, upon the quality of
arterial tissue (vital rubber) which the individual has inherited
and secondarily upon the amount of wear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
tear to which he has subjected it. That the former plays
the most important rôle is shown in the cases in which
arteriosclerosis sets in early in life in individuals in
whom none of the recognized etiological factors can be
found. Entire families sometimes show this tendency
to early arteriosclerosis, a tendency which cannot be
explained in any other way than that in the make-up of
the machine bad material was used for the tubing."</p>

<p>Our present knowledge as to the relation of syphilis
to this disease has not changed the significance of the
observations made by Osler in any way. Heredity more
than any other one factor undoubtedly determines the
development of both senility and arteriosclerosis.
"When," as Lambert<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> expresses it, "physiological involution
anticipates in time or exceeds in direction, extent
and severity normal senescence, the various senile
and arteriosclerotic disorders are the result." It is as a
rule only in the later stages of the disease when focal
symptoms occur or a psychosis develops that hospital
care becomes necessary. Practically any of the vessels
of the brain may be involved and it frequently happens
that more than one is affected either directly or indirectly.
The neurological symptoms resulting depend entirely
on the location and extent of the lesion. Lambert<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
has made the following excellent anatomical
classification of the more common arteriosclerotic processes:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p2a">I.   Incipient type.</p>
<p class="p2a">II.  Focal types.</p>
   <p class="p3">(a) Trunk disorders.</p>
      <p class="p4a">1. Basilar-carotids.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
   <p class="p3">(b) Branch disorders.</p>
      <p class="p4a">1. Inferior cerebellar.</p>
      <p class="p4a">2. Superior cerebellar.</p>
      <p class="p4a">3. Posterior cerebral.</p>
      <p class="p4a">4. Middle cerebral.</p>
      <p class="p4a">5. Anterior cerebral.</p>
   <p class="p3">(c) Twig disorders.</p>
      <p class="p4a">1. Medullary.</p>
      <p class="p4a">2. Cortical.</p>


<p class="p2">Some reference should be made, perhaps, to the focal
symptoms resulting from more or less sharply circumscribed
lesions which are productive of certain fairly well
known complexes, whether due to arteriosclerotic softenings,
hemorrhages, or growths. These have been concisely
summarized by Barker<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> somewhat as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Frontal Lobes&mdash;Lesions of the left inferior frontal in
righthanded persons cause motor aphasia. Subcortical
involvements cause word dumbness. Disturbances in the
anterior part of the frontal region are sometimes associated
with the Witzelsucht of the German writers&mdash;a
tendency towards joking and witticisms.</p>

<p>Central and Paracentral Lobules&mdash;Contralateral sensory,
motor symptoms or a combination of the two.
Monoplegias, anesthesias and Jacksonian epilepsies are
characteristic. Contralateral tactile agnosia and apraxia
occur, especially in lesions of the left hemisphere. An
involvement of the left side may also cause a homolateral
apraxia, dyspraxia or a tactile agnosia.</p>

<p>Parietal Lobes&mdash;Lesions in the anterior part cause
contralateral somesthetic disturbances, tactile agnosia
or apraxia. Involvement of the left angular gyrus may
cause optic aphasia or alexia; if deep enough, hemianopsia
results. The voluntary movement of the eye may be
interfered with.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>Temporal Lobe&mdash;Lesions in the posterior half of the
first temporal may cause Wernicke's sensory aphasia
and a subcortical involvement, word deafness. Bilateral
destruction of the first and transverse temporals causes
cortical deafness. Extensive bilateral lesions in the lower
part of these lobes result in mind deafness. Irritative
lesions in the uncinate gyrus lead to hallucinations of
taste and smell, with smacking of the lips and tongue
movements.</p>

<p>Island of Reil&mdash;Lesions of the anterior part cause
symptoms resembling Broca's motor aphasia. Lesions
of the posterior part result in symptoms suggesting
Wernicke's sensory aphasia. Transcortical motor and
sensory aphasia may result.</p>

<p>Occipital Lobes&mdash;Lesions of the calcarine area give
rise to hemianopsia, and bicortical involvements lead to
cortical blindness. Bilateral lesions of the lateral surface
may cause mind blindness.</p>

<p>Disturbances in the centrum ovale may cause monoplegias
or monoanesthesias, and lesions in the corpus
callosum, apraxic symptoms. Characteristic of cerebellar
lesions are ataxias and disturbances of equilibrium,
often with vertigo and paroxysmal vomiting.</p>

<p>An involvement of the corpora quadrigemina may
cause pupillary changes, unilateral or bilateral paralysis
of eye muscles, nystagmus, visual disturbances, deafness
and ataxia or anesthesia.</p>

<p>Lesions of the cerebral peduncles may give rise to
very characteristic syndromes. If the tegmentum and
pes pedunculi (basis pedunculi) are both involved, there
may be a complete hemiplegia of the opposite side with
an oculomotor paralysis on the same side (Weber-Gubler
syndrome). Or there may be in addition to this a marked
tremor in the limbs of the paralyzed side (Benedikt's
syndrome). A unilateral oculomotor paralysis may be
combined with a cerebellar ataxia (Nothnagel's syndrome).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
The thalmic syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy shows
a contralateral hemianesthesia, violent and persistent
pains on the anesthetic side, hemiataxia, hemichorea or
hemiathetosis, slight temporary hemiparesis and sometimes
hyperesthesia. Lesions further back, possibly involving
the internal capsule, may cause hemianesthesia
of touch, pain and temperature senses.</p>

<p>S. A. K. Wilson in 1912 called attention to a particularly
important syndrome, designated by him as "progressive
lenticular degeneration" and characterized by
dysarthria, dysphagia, general tremors of the extremities,
forced laughing and crying, muscular rigidities and
contractures, with a slight intellectual impairment. Interesting
features of this disease complex are that it is
familial in type, but not hereditary, comes on early in
life, usually progressing to a fatal termination, and is
associated with a cirrhosis of the liver which is not alcoholic
in origin. At autopsy degenerations of the nucleus
lentiformis have been found. J. Ramsey Hunt in
1916 called attention to the association of both paralysis
agitans and Huntington's chorea with lesions in the
globus pallidus. Oppenheim has recently differentiated
a striatum syndrome to which he gave the name "dystonia
musculorum." Difficulties in writing, tremors, disturbance
of the gait, rigidities, tonic and clonic movements
of the muscles and other neurological symptoms
are present. Several cases reported by Abrahamson in
1920 showed definite emotional disturbances. Cecile and
Oskar Vogt have recently (1919) studied the striatum lesions
from a standpoint of both pathology and symptomatology.
As summarized by Lhermitte<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> their work
shows that athetosis, paralysis agitans, Huntington's
chorea, dystonia musculorum, probably paralysis agitans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and various other neurological syndromes are to be attributed
directly to conditions involving the striate
bodies. Prominent among these are softenings and hemorrhages
which may result from arteriosclerosis. In
view of these facts a careful study of the focal lesions
associated with the arteriosclerotic disorders is exceedingly
important.</p>

<p>The pathological processes involved have been carefully
studied by Heubner and others. He was originally
of the opinion that cerebral arteriosclerosis was always
of specific origin. Baumgarten, however, subsequently
showed that this was not the case. The more characteristic
changes in the larger vessels manifest themselves
in the form of patches of atheromatous thickening so
common at autopsy. As a result of degenerative changes
in the elastica and media, and a consequent weakening
of the vessel wall, intimal thickening takes place. This
is not the circular, uniform, concentric involvement found
in syphilitic processes but a localized proliferation of the
intima at some one point. There may be an infiltration
of colloid and calcareous material in the media. This
leads to further intimal thickening. In the smaller vessels
arteriocapillary fibrosis has been described&mdash;a uniform
thickening of the vessel walls with a connective tissue
formation. Endarteritis obliterans, first described
by Friedländer in 1876, is probably always of syphilitic
origin.</p>

<p>In addition to the vascular changes in the cerebral
vessels Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> finds usually atheromatous changes
in the aorta and its branches, particularly the coronaries,
with ulcerations or calcareous plates, hypertrophy and
dilatation of the heart, myocarditis, interstitial nephritis
and infarctions of various organs. At autopsy the dura
and pia are usually thickened and adherent, with a general
atrophy of the cerebral convolutions. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
often fresh hemorrhages under the membranes as well
as cyst formations and dilatation of the brain ventricles.
He particularly emphasizes a splitting of the elastica in
the larger cerebral vessels with a thickening and tortuosity,
fatty infiltration and calcareous deposits. Hyaline
degeneration is common in the elastica and muscularis
with fatty granular cells in the adventitia. Capillary
aneurysms are often found. Glia proliferation is to be
expected in the surrounding area. A condition described
by Alzheimer as perivascular gliosis often occurs. There
is a disappearance of the perivascular nervous elements
with consequent proliferation of the neuroglia. In a
general way Kraepelin differentiates several distinct
pathological groups&mdash;a diffuse cortical involvement, circumscribed
processes in the neighborhood of vessels,
hemorrhages and softenings. There is also a loss of
nerve fibres which are replaced by neuroglia. Binswanger
has described a "chronic subcortical encephalitis"
due to arteriosclerosis. This consists of an atrophy
of the white matter due to an involvement of the deeper
marrow vessels. Large gaps and lacunae are found in
the course of the vessels. There is an extensive atrophy
of the fibres and there may be occasional foci of softening.
As a general rule involvement of the large vessels is
liable to affect the medullary substance while sclerosis of
the smaller vessels leads to cortical disturbances. It is
also possible to have extensive lesions without mental
symptoms and well developed psychoses with only a
slight physical basis. The site of the damage to the
vessels determines this. On the other hand, the mental
condition may be due to cardiovascular complications resulting
usually in anxiety psychoses. The symptomatology
may be complicated by senility, alcoholism or
syphilis.</p>

<p>Clinically Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168">
</a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> divides the arteriosclerotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
psychoses into deteriorations, or milder forms of mental
enfeeblement, dementias, depressions, excitements, late
epilepsies, and apoplectic dementia. In the milder forms
there is a gradual change in the entire psychic personality,
with a later development of more marked changes,
either physical, mental or both. The early symptoms are
a general reduction of the mental capacity and an impairment
of memory. The patient tires easily and loses
all evidences of energy, with no inclination to undertake
anything new. Familiar names and dates are forgotten.
Recent occurrences are particularly lost to memory. The
real is confused with the false. In business the patient
becomes careless and unreliable, overlooks important
transactions and forgets appointments. There are often
subjective feelings of impending illness. The mood becomes
depressed, whining and tearful. Irritability and
outbursts of anger occasionally appear, characterized by
a marked emotional instability, varying rapidly from
tears to laughter. Suicidal tendencies are sometimes
noted. Mild confusional states may be induced by alcoholic
indulgences. Early physical symptoms are headache,
sensations of fulness and pressure in the head,
followed by a feeling of dizziness, fatigue, exhaustion,
debility, etc. Sooner or later, following a seizure of some
kind, neurological signs appear&mdash;drooping of the mouth,
lateral deviation of the tongue, weakness of an arm,
dragging of one leg, loss of sensation on one side, ankle
clonus, an increase, decrease or inequality of the patellar
reflexes, and sometimes a Babinski reflex. The pupils
are very likely to be unequal and sluggish in reaction.
The features present a tired, sleepy expression and
speech becomes tremulous and monotonous. There may
be a difficulty in finding words, or the misuse of words.
There are usually tremors of the fingers and movements
are uncertain, the gait being unsteady. Romberg's
symptom may be present. Dizzy spells and fainting attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
also occur, sometimes followed by genuine convulsions.
Apoplectiform seizures may be observed, with
unconsciousness for hours or days. These may be followed
by sensory or motor aphasia, unilateral paralysis
with or without disturbances of sensation, hemianopsia,
alexia, agraphia, asymbolism or apraxia. Cardiac disturbances
with anxieties are often complications. These
apoplectiform and other severe attacks sometimes occur a
long time after mental symptoms have appeared. They
are likely to recur, mental deterioration progressing
rapidly with the repetition of the seizures.</p>

<p>Apprehension is much disturbed and memory weakened,
in the advanced cases of deterioration. The patients
cannot remember anything for more than a short
time. They become disoriented as to time, place and
person and forget their own names. Genuine "confabulation"
sometimes appears. There are often confusional
and delirious states. The mood is frequently depressed
or anxious, sometimes irritable or quarrelsome and
at times humorous. There is a group of cases showing
genuine depressions, usually with hypochondriacal
delusions, sometimes with delusions of persecution,
self-accusation, and ideas of sinfulness. Even delusions
of grandeur are observed. Hallucinations
are not infrequent in these cases. States of excitement
may intervene with occasional delusions and
confused attacks. These excitements are usually of
the agitated, restless type, sometimes with suicidal inclinations.
Stuporous or even cataleptic states may follow.
In the highest forms of excitement sensory or motor
aphasia may develop, often with speech disturbances,
sometimes of a genuine scanning type. Paraphasias are
common. The writing is ataxic or paragraphic. Ideational
or motor apraxia often is a symptom. Cyanoses
and other evidences of general arteriosclerotic involvement
appear. There may be an albuminuric retinitis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Albumen and sometimes sugar appear in the urine. The
radials and temporals are thickened or hardened and
cardiac murmurs are often found. Blood pressure is
greatly increased in many instances, although Romberg
found it in only ten per cent of his cases. Sleep is
usually interfered with to a marked degree.</p>

<p>In a certain number of the more advanced cases of
arteriosclerosis late epilepsies appear. The attacks
usually begin between the forty-fifth and sixty-fifth years.
There may be fainting spells or genuine convulsions recurring
at frequent intervals. These may be associated
with brief periods of delirium or may even occur without
loss of consciousness. Forgetfulness and mental
enfeeblement soon appear in such cases. They also show
physical changes with tremors, disturbed reflexes, paralyses,
increased blood pressure, etc. Alcoholism seems to
be a strongly predisposing factor in this form of arteriosclerotic
disorder. Kraepelin found that the epileptic attacks
almost invariably appeared in cases which showed
a previous history of alcoholic excesses.</p>

<p>In nearly half of his cases Kraepelin found apoplectiform
attacks appearing without any marked psychosis
preceding them. In some instances no mental symptoms
appeared for many years. The attacks were, however,
immediately followed, usually, by periods of confusion
and clouding, sometimes of excitement and violence. The
acute disturbance as a rule subsides rather quickly and
clears up partially or completely. Usually there remains
a memory defect, an increased fatigability and a depressed
or irritable mood. These he refers to as cases
of apoplectic deterioration or mental enfeeblement. Recurrent
apoplectiform seizures may result in excitement,
depressions or deliria. Gradual progressive deterioration
is the usual picture. As a general rule the cases with
marked excitements, depressions and deliria are of short
duration and have a bad prognosis.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Kraepelin finds that the arteriosclerotic psychoses
appear a decade earlier than the senile psychoses. Less
than one per cent developed at the age of forty; 2.7 per
cent at forty-five; 3.7 per cent at fifty; 7.4 per cent at
fifty-five; twenty-two per cent at sixty; twenty-two per
cent at sixty-five; 18.57 per cent at seventy; twelve per
cent at seventy-five, etc. In the cases observed at a particularly
early age he believes heredity to be a very important
factor. Seventy-one and five-tenths per cent of
his cases were men. Sixty-two per cent of the men and
fifty-three per cent of the women were less than sixty-five
years of age. The epileptic and demented forms appear
earlier than the apoplectiform variety. Arteriosclerotic
involvement of the smaller vessels occurs earlier than
that of the larger arteries. Kraepelin found alcoholism
more common in the history of his cases than syphilis.
He is uncertain whether specific infections can produce
a genuine arteriosclerosis or not.</p>

<p>Erb has shown that by the experimental injection of
adrenalin into the blood stream artificial arteriosclerosis
can be produced, with an increase of blood pressure, splitting
of the elastica, thickening of the vessel walls and
aneurysm formation. Thoma considers alcohol, tobacco,
coffee, tea, and infectious poisons important causes.
Cramer found the disease more common in innkeepers,
actors, directors, officers, bankers and parliamentarians.
Alcohol, syphilis, overwork and high living are important
etiological factors. Kraepelin assumes the existence of
certain metabolic products in the blood, possibly the result
of infections which affect blood pressure and the
structure of the vessel walls during a period of lowered
resistance.</p>

<p>The pathological changes associated with the arteriosclerotic
psychoses are quite clearly demarcated. Clinical
differentiations, however, are not so well established.
There is some question as to the justification of the separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
entities into which Kraepelin would divide the arteriosclerotic
processes. For statistical purposes the Association's
committee felt that a determination of the frequency
of occurrence of the arteriosclerotic group as a
whole is all that should be attempted at this time. The
following suggestions were offered in the manual as to
the delimitations of these <span class="no-break">conditions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The clinical symptoms, both mental and physical, are
varied depending in the first place on the distribution and
severity of the vascular cerebral disease and probably to
some extent on the mental make-up of the person.</p>

<p>"Cerebral physical symptoms, headaches, dizziness,
fainting attacks, etc., are nearly always present, and
usually signs of focal brain disease appear sooner or
later (aphasia, paralysis, etc.).</p>

<p>"The most important mental symptoms (particularly
if the arteriosclerotic disease is diffuse) are impairment
of mental tension, <i>i.e.</i>, interference with the capacity to
think quickly and accurately, to concentrate and to fix
the attention; fatigability and lack of emotional control
(alternate weeping and laughing), often a tendency to
irritability is marked; the retention is impaired and with
it there is more or less general defect of memory, especially
in the advanced stages of the disease, or after some
large destructive lesion occurs.</p>

<p>"Pronounced psychotic symptoms may appear in the
form of depression (often of the anxious type), suspicions
or paranoid ideas, or episodes of marked confusion.</p>

<p>"To be included in this group are the psychoses following
cerebral softening or hemorrhage, if due to arterial
disease. (Autopsies in state hospitals show that in
arteriosclerotic cases softening is relatively much more
frequent than hemorrhage.)</p>

<p>"Differentiation from senile psychosis is sometimes
difficult particularly if the arteriosclerotic disease manifests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
itself in the senile period. The two conditions may
be associated; when this happens preference should be
given in the statistical report to the arteriosclerotic disorder.</p>

<p>"High blood pressure, although usually present, is not
essential for the diagnosis of cerebral arteriosclerosis."</p>

<p>In the 49,640 admissions to the New York state hospitals
during a period of eight years the 2,318 cases
diagnosed as psychoses with arteriosclerosis constituted
4.67 per cent of the total number. In twenty-one
hospitals in other states there were 18,336 admissions,
of which 492, or 2.68 per cent, were cases of arteriosclerosis.
On the other hand, the Massachusetts hospitals
show 9.63 per cent of their first admissions during 1919
as arteriosclerotic psychoses. There would appear to be
no way to harmonize these dissimilar findings unless it
is merely a question of differentiation between the senile
psychoses and those due to arteriosclerosis. In a total
of 70,987 admissions to all institutions, there were 3,100
cases of arteriosclerotic psychoses, a percentage of 4.36.
It is worthy of note that in all of the various groups of
institutions the percentage of senile and arteriosclerotic
cases combined is practically the same. This would
strongly suggest varying standards of diagnosis which
will undoubtedly be reconciled in time. It is only recently
that any great amount of attention has been given to
the psychoses due to arteriosclerosis and it must be confessed
that there has been entirely too great a tendency
to dismiss without further interest as senile psychoses
all mental disturbances occurring in persons of advanced
years. On the other hand, the custom of basing a diagnosis
of arteriosclerotic psychosis on the mere presence
of an increased blood pressure without the existence of
any of the other symptoms which characterize that condition
indicates, if nothing else, the necessity of a greater
uniformity in our methods of diagnostic procedure.</p>

<span class="st">GENERAL PARALYSIS</span></h3>
</div>

<p>General paralysis of the insane, general paresis, or
dementia paralytica, as it is variously known, from the
standpoint of etiology, symptomatology and pathology,
is unquestionably the most clearly differentiated and
sharply circumscribed of the psychoses at this time. Its
history, like its pathology, is inseparable from that of
syphilis&mdash;a subject of never failing interest and importance,
from the time of the first appearance of that word
in a poem (Syphilidis, sive morbi Gallici) written by the
Italian physician and poet Fracastoro in 1530. Guarinoni
referred to epilepsies due to syphilis in the seventeenth
century. Frequent allusions are made in the literature
of that period to manifestations of the disease in
the nervous system. Thomas Willis called attention to
the association of paralysis with mental disorders as
early as 1672. A form of mania due to syphilis was described
by Sanché in 1777. Jelliffe found references in
literature to a specific leptomeningitis in 1766 and paraplegias
in 1771. Haslam, a pharmacist at the Bethlem
Hospital, is said to have given a fairly accurate description
of general paresis in 1798. A French writer, A. L.
Bayle, is usually spoken of as having clearly differentiated
the disease in 1822. The work of Calmeil, "De la
Paralysie Consididérée chez les aliénés," in 1826, was, however,
the first elaborate monograph ever written on this
important psychosis and established its recognition as
an entity. Griesinger looked upon it as a combination of
different mental conditions. Esquirol is credited with
having been the first to describe the speech defect now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
considered such an important symptom. Baillarger is
said to have introduced the term dementia paralytica in
1846.</p>

<p>The etiology of the disease was a subject of controversy
for many years. The early writers ascribed it to
sexual excesses, masturbation, alcoholism, heredity, overwork,
and various other causes. It was looked upon by
some as one of the sequelae of syphilis and was described
as a "meta syphilitic" disease by Möbius and a "para
syphilitic" disorder by Fournier. It was noted by many
as occurring only in the more intellectual and highly developed
races and was therefore referred to by Krafft-Ebing
as a disease of "syphilization and civilization."
Both Bayle and Esquirol mentioned syphilis very casually
in their writings. Sandras in 1852 spoke of it as one of
the principal causes of general paresis. Its etiological
importance was, however, first given serious consideration
by Esmarch and Jessen, prominent Danish writers,
in 1857. Their views were corroborated by Steenberg in
1860 and by Kjellberg in 1863. The theory of an exclusively
specific origin was not generally accepted, however,
for many years. Rieger published elaborate statistics
in 1886 showing that the incidence of general paresis
was sixteen or seventeen times as great in syphilitics as
it was in healthy persons. The fact that a definite history
of infection was not available in many cases led to
considerable doubt. Such eminent authorities as Charcot,
Binswanger and Déjerine went so far as to deny that
there was any relation between the two diseases. That
some uncertainty was warranted by the information at
hand is shown by the fact that Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> found a history
of syphilis in seventy-eight per cent of his cases,
while Sprengeler reported 41.5 per cent, Räcke 57.3 per
cent, Torkel fifty-one per cent, Marcus seventy-six per
cent, Houghberg 86.9 per cent, and Alzheimer over ninety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
per cent. This is not at all surprising in view of the
statement made by Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> that Hirschl could find a
definite history of an initial lesion in only thirty-six per
cent of his cases of tertiary syphilis. Hudovernig found
that 42.3 per cent of the women suffering from syphilis
did not know when they were infected. In discussing
this subject in 1897 Krafft-Ebing reported the inoculation
of nine paretics with syphilitic virus without the appearance
of luetic symptoms in any instance, although
reinfections have been mentioned by other authorities.</p>

<p>One of the first advances which contributed materially
to the ultimate solution of the general paresis problem
was the study of the cerebrospinal fluid by Widal, Sicard
and others after the introduction of lumbar puncture by
Quincke in 1890. This led eventually to discoveries which
were of great diagnostic importance. The isolation of
the spirochaeta pallidum, now known as the treponema
pallidum, by Schaudinn in 1905 settled the question for
all time as to the cause of syphilis. The adaptation of
the principle of complement fixation, the so-called Bordet-Gengon
phenomenon, to the study of syphilitic fluids by
Wassermann, Neisser and Bruck in 1906 practically removed
all doubt as to the relation between that disease
and general paresis. The demonstration of the treponema
in the cortex of paretics by Moore and Noguchi
in 1913 was practically the only other contribution necessary.
They have since been found in the cerebrospinal
fluid. Notwithstanding the fact that general paresis
must now be looked upon as being a manifestation of
syphilis beyond all peradventure of a doubt, it is nevertheless
true that we are unable to explain why that disease
does not always yield to specific treatment. This
is undeniably the case at this time. Just why this should
be so cannot be explained in the light of our present
knowledge. It is, however, presumably for the same reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
that tabes and other diseases of the cord and nervous
system, the specific origin of which cannot logically be
questioned, are equally resistant to salvarsan and mercury,
whatever that reason may be.</p>

<p>As soon as the findings of the Wassermann reaction
became evident, renewed efforts on the part of clinicians
to find a cure for general paresis naturally followed.
One of the first suggested was the Swift-Ellis treatment.
This was based on the injection of salvarsanized
blood serum into the subdural space of the spinal canal.
Results were exceedingly encouraging for a while, but
time showed that this was not the solution of the problem.
Intravenous salvarsan administration was next
tried. This, too, gave excellent results at first. The
cases which were apparently cured, however, eventually
relapsed sooner or later in almost every instance. The
intraspinous use of salvarsan in minute doses has been
no more successful than the Swift-Ellis method. Intracranial
subdural treatments have been tried and salvarsan
has even been injected directly into the lateral ventricles.
The logical conclusion is either that the destruction
of the nervous tissue has already reached a stage
which is beyond repair or that the treatment does not
reach the site of the disease.</p>

<p>Clinically we are on much safer ground. In his third
edition Krafft-Ebing<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> referred to dementia paralytica
as "periencephalomeningitis diffusa," the term originally
employed by Calmeil. "Clinically this disease is
manifested as a rule as a chronic disease of the brain
with vasomotor, psychic, and motor, functional disturbances,
progressive in course, with a duration of from two
to three years and nearly always a fatal termination."</p>

<p>Régis,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
before the cause of the disease was definitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
determined, defined general paralysis as a "cerebral disorder,
sometimes cerebro-spinal (diffuse chronic interstitial
meningo-myelo-encephalitis) essentially characterized
by progressive symptoms of dementia and paralysis
(paralytic dementia) with which are frequently associated
various accessory symptoms, and especially an
insanity of the maniacal, melancholic, or circular type
(paralytic insanity)."</p>

<p>Since the time the disease was described by Bayle,
general paresis has usually been spoken of as being represented
clinically by three different stages. White<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
speaks of a prodromal period, one of full development
and a terminal stage. In the first period he emphasizes
the importance of physical symptoms, more particularly
the oculomotor and tendon reflex disturbances. These
include the sluggish reaction to light (28.3 per cent) or
an actual Argyll-Robertson pupil (45 per cent), with an
increased, decreased or absent knee-jerk, the exaggerated
form being the most common. The mental symptoms
may be entirely overlooked in the first stage. There is
a gradual progressive deterioration of the personality,
with a loss of efficiency, impairment of memory, and failure
of judgment. There may be episodes of excitement,
depression or delirium, with or without hallucinations
and delusions, the latter being either hypochondriacal or
grandiose. "The demented type, without marked delusions
or sensory falsifications, is the truly typical variety
of the disease and the dementia the basal element of
all forms" (White). There may be an incipient speech
disorder and beginning tremor.</p>

<p>Characteristic of the second stage is a marked increase
of the physical symptoms already described, together
with the appearance of seizures. Muscular weakness
develops and the patient often shows a marked gain
in weight. The mental symptoms are merely an exacerbation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of those shown in the first stage. The expansive
variety constitutes the classic form so often spoken of.
There may be agitations, depressions, alternations of
these symptoms or even paranoid forms.</p>

<p>In the third stage there is a continued exaggeration
of the physical signs of the disease with an advancing
mental deterioration. The patient becomes helpless and
practically speechless, contractures and bedsores develop,
and death often occurs as the result of an unusually violent
seizure. The description of this disease in the three
traditional stages so often referred to is practically
without significance and of very questionable value. It
is, of course, a well-known fact that the disease may progress
rapidly to a termination in two or three years or
may continue for an almost indefinite period of time.
It may manifest itself, furthermore, in various ways.
The physical signs show much greater constancy than the
mental symptoms.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> describes demented, depressed, expansive
and agitated forms of general paresis. The "demented"
form he finds to be much more common than the
others. This is characterized by a progressive mental deterioration
with "paralysis." The onset is marked by a
poverty of thought, forgetfulness, moodiness, instability
and indifference. Consciousness gradually becomes somewhat
clouded and the patient more or less disoriented.
Transitory delusions supervene. These are of a depressive
type, somatic or expansive in nature. The delusional
ideas as a general rule are rather childish. Memory
disorder becomes conspicuous and delirious excitements
occur at times. All of this leads to a gradual deterioration.
Speech defects appear sooner or later and conduct
disorders are common. Kraepelin finds that fifty-three
per cent of his Heidelberg cases were of the demented
form. At Munich they constituted fifty-six per cent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the men and seventy-three per cent of the women. Forty-four
per cent of the cases died within the first two years.</p>

<p>The "depressive" form of paresis as described by
Kraepelin is characterized by emotional depression or
anxiety with delusions of various kinds. It may begin
with a general sensation of illness and a gradual weakness
of memory or intellect followed by symptoms of
mental dulness. The unpleasant ideas are hypochondriacal
in nature and often of an extravagant type. The delusions
are quite frequently somatic in origin. Sometimes
these are associated with self-accusation or there
may be complaints of persecution. Hallucinations occur
at times. In spite of this deplorable state of affairs a
marked indifference on the part of the patient is the
rule. Excitement, violence or suicidal impulses nevertheless
occur, and stuporous states are described. Kraepelin
found that the depressive form constituted twelve
per cent of his cases at Heidelberg. He is of the opinion
that the duration is short, much more so than in some of
the other types of the disease. Fifty-eight and six-tenths
per cent died within the first two years. Convulsions,
however, were less frequent.</p>

<p>The "expansive form," according to Kraepelin, may
begin with an initial depression or show excitement early.
Megalomanic symptoms of the most extravagant variety
soon appear. The marked mental weakness is, however,
very manifest. Hallucinations of sight and hearing are
frequently present but transitory. The mood is usually
happy, although hypochondriacal ideas occur for short
periods now and then. Excitability is more common,
sometimes with unusual violence. The course tends to
a complete deterioration, with occasional exacerbations
of excitement. Kraepelin found that the expansive form
constituted about thirty per cent of his Heidelberg cases.
Convulsions were less frequent and remissions more common
than in other types. He found that this form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
disease, moreover, occurred later in life. Forty per
cent died within the first two years. Some cases, on the
other hand, were of long duration; one of seven, another
of eight, and one of fourteen years. He also noted mixed
varieties with alternations between excitement and depression.</p>

<p>The "agitated" form as described by Kraepelin is
that type in which extreme excitements predominate. It
is often of sudden onset. Grandiose ideas, even more
extravagant than those of the expansive form, appear.
A flight of ideas may be observed at times and stupor
often intervenes. The most severe cases are those which
have been referred to by some writers as "galloping"
paresis. An actual delirium may lead to an early termination
in death. The agitated type constituted 6.3 per
cent of Kraepelin's cases. He finds this condition somewhat
analogous to the delirious states due to alcoholism.</p>

<p>Remissions are more common in the agitated and expansive
forms of the disease and may vary in duration
from a few months in some instances to one of fourteen
years reported by Dobrschansky. Nissl confirmed the
diagnosis of paresis at autopsy in a case observed by
Tuczek which had been stationary for nearly twenty
years. Alzheimer reported another with a known duration
of thirty-two years. Kraepelin has found, however,
that fifty per cent of his paretics die within the first two
years. He reports unequal pupils in from fifty to sixty
per cent of those examined. He also finds that pupillary
irregularity is one of the earliest physical signs in many
individuals. Complete loss of light reaction was found
in from fifty to sixty per cent of all cases, with a reduced
range of reaction in from thirty to forty per cent. He
found epileptiform or other attacks present in from
thirty to forty per cent of those studied. Decreased or
absent patellar reflexes were noted about twice as often
as were increased reflexes. In from two-thirds to three-fourths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of all cases he found both the posterior column
and lateral tracts of the cord involved.</p>

<p>The characteristic physical signs noted in all textbooks
are described in detail by Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> as common
to all of the clinical forms of the disease. The inequality,
irregularity and immobility of the pupils, the speech defect,
difficulty in writing, tremor of the lips, facial muscles
and tongue, the marked changes in both superficial
and deep reflexes, the alterations in the gait, the muscular
incoordination, the presence of the Babinski reflex
or ankle clonus, the sensory, motor, vasomotor and
trophic disturbances constitute a combination of physical
signs which is to be found practically nowhere else
within the domain of psychiatry. The seizures, either
epileptiform, apoplectiform or resembling syncopes, are
almost pathognomonic when taken into consideration
with the physical signs alone.</p>

<p>The pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid is from three
to five times as great as in normal individuals. The
albumen content of the fluid is increased about six times
(Kraepelin). The increase in the globulin content has
been very frequently referred to in the literature of general
paresis. Kraepelin states that it also occurs in tabes,
syphilis, brain abscess, occasional cases of extra medullary
tumors, multiple sclerosis and in some infectious diseases.
He attaches a great deal of importance to the increase
in the cellular elements of the spinal fluid.
"Cases with repeated normal findings are so rare that
the correctness of the diagnosis may be justly doubted."
The Wassermann findings no longer require comment.
The colloidal gold test of Lange is equally well known.
Nowhere else in psychiatric procedure does the laboratory
render such valuable diagnostic assistance as is the
rule in cases of general paresis. A positive Wassermann
reaction in the spinal fluid, the presence of an increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in the albumen and globulin content, with a marked
lymphocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid and a positive
gold test, is quite sufficient evidence on which to base a
definite diagnosis. The results of an examination of the
spinal fluid for diagnostic purposes at the time of autopsy
are highly unreliable. An increase in the cell count,
which may be misleading, is found in the spinal fluid of
non-paretics in all cases after death. The number of
cells depends entirely on the time of examination. It is
not at all unusual to find from one to three hundred per
cubic millimeter when a count is made from twenty-four
to forty-eight hours after the death of the patient.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Another
interesting fact is that the presence of sugar always
shown by Fehling's solution during life cannot be demonstrated
postmortem, at least after the lapse of a few
hours.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The significance of this change is not clear.
Nor is the increase in the globulin content of the spinal
fluid, when taken alone, pathognomonic of either general
paresis or syphilis, as was pointed out in 1909.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> One of
the most elaborate studies ever made of the spinal fluid,
that of F. W. Mott, shows that this increase is due to
degenerative processes of the nervous system which may
be due to a variety of causes.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>In no other psychosis do we find such clear-cut pathological
findings at autopsy as are readily demonstrable
in general paresis. We are very largely indebted to the
exhaustive researches of Nissl and Alzheimer, (1904)<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
for our information on this subject. Macroscopically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
adhesions of the dura to the calvarium and of the pia to
the cortical substance are quite common. Opacities of the
meninges are practically always present. Pachymeningitis
hemorrhagica, externa or interna, is common, often
with the formation of extensive hemorrhagic membranes.
Ependymitis may be readily observed in the floor of the
fourth and lateral ventricles. There is usually a reduction
in the general brain weight, with atrophy of various
parts, usually one side or the other of the cerebrum. The
sulci are widened and the frontal lobes are often noticeably
smaller in size. Less frequently the temporal, parietal
or occipital regions are affected. Often there are
localized foci of atrophy with cyst formation. The ventricles
are frequently widely dilated, with an increase of
cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

<p>Microscopic examination always shows a more or
less diffuse leptomeningitis with a markedly thickened
pia infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells. In
the superficial layers of the cortex there is a neuroglia
proliferation with characteristic "spider cells." There
is an obvious disturbance of the normal layering of the
cortex which is very striking. The adventitia of the vascular
walls shows an extensive infiltration by lymphocytes
and particularly by plasma cells which are often
very numerous. Rod cells or "stäbchenzellen" as described
by Alzheimer are very noticeable as are also satellite
cells or free nuclei. The neurones are often diminished
in number and frequently show the "acute" or "grave"
alterations described by Nissl, as well as shrinkage,
sclerosis, pigmentary deposits, vacuolization, etc. The
characteristic axonal alteration originally described by
Turner as occurring in central neuritis is sometimes observed.
Degeneration of the nerve fibres may be
brought out by proper staining processes. Intimal
thickening of the vessel walls and a capillary proliferation
or budding should also be mentioned. Foci of softening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
sometimes are to be found in the cortex. The presence
of occasional gummata is now conceded, although formerly
denied by Alzheimer. The changes in the cerebellum
are not essentially different, but are usually not
so conspicuous. In the cord a pachymeningitis and leptomeningitis
are usually present, as well as the vascular
changes described above. The important findings, however,
are the degeneration of the posterior columns and
lateral tracts, or mixed forms involving both of these.
Owing doubtless to defects in staining technique, the
demonstration of the treponema is difficult and unsatisfactory.
It must be admitted that some of the above histopathological
changes in themselves, the cell alterations,
for instance, do not, when considered alone, prove the
existence of general paresis. The whole picture as shown
by the microscope, however, leaves no room for argument.
The postmortem diagnosis is absolutely conclusive.</p>

<p>A consideration of the subject of general paresis
without some reference to the juvenile form, first described
by Clouston in 1877, would be manifestly incomplete.
Although this term may be applied to a type of
the disease acquired in childhood, it is usually used as
referring to hereditary syphilis. Symptoms generally
appear at or before the age of puberty. As a general
rule the child is more or less defective mentally from
birth, although this is not always true. Ordinarily the
course of the disease is one of progressive deterioration,
with an occasional episode of excitement. Convulsive
seizures are frequent, and contractures are often noted.
These cases are likely to be mistaken for idiocy and overlooked.
The duration usually extends over a period of
several years. The pathology is practically the same as
that of the adult form of the disease. Almost invariably
a positive Wassermann is obtained on examining the
blood of the parents. It is equally interesting to note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
that the children of syphilitic parents often show a positive
Wassermann reaction without any evidence of paresis,
or at least for some time before it develops.</p>

<p>The only question remaining at this time is whether
general paresis and cerebral syphilis are separate and
distinct disease entities. For many years this was held
to be the case. Certainly gummata and other syphilitic
processes are to be found in the brain where there is no
such pathological picture as characterizes general paresis.
In any event the latter must be recognized as a very
well defined form of syphilis of the nervous system. In
view of the very definite etiology, symptomatology and
pathology of general paresis, the various clinical differentiations
of Kraepelin and other writers are looked upon
by many as not being of very great importance. In any
and all clinical types, however described, we are unquestionably
dealing with the same sharply circumscribed disease
process. This subject is one of academic interest
only.</p>

<p>The American Psychiatric Association in its classification
of psychoses made no attempt to differentiate
types. For purposes of statistical study the following
suggestions appear in the manual:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The range of symptoms encountered in general
paralysis is too great to be reviewed here in detail. As
to mental symptoms, most stress should be laid on the
early changes in disposition and character, judgment
defects, difficulty about time relations and discrepancies
in statements, forgetfulness and later on a diffuse memory
impairment. Cases with marked grandiose trends
are less likely to be overlooked than cases with depressions,
paranoid ideas, alcoholic-like episodes, etc.</p>

<p>"Mistakes of diagnosis are most apt to be made in
those cases having in the early stages pronounced psychotic
symptoms and relatively slight defect symptoms,
or in cases with few definite physical signs. Lumbar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
puncture should always be made if there is any doubt
about the diagnosis. A Wassermann examination of the
blood alone is not sufficient as this does not tell us
whether or not the central nervous system is involved."</p>

<p>A study of the statistics of the thirteen New York
state hospitals in the "pre-Wassermann" days and before
we had acquired our present accurate knowledge of
the pathology of general paresis shows that there were
84,152 admissions during the fourteen years ending on
October 1, 1888. Of this number 5,697, or 6.76 per cent,
were diagnosed as general paresis. In the same hospitals,
from 1912 to 1919 inclusive, 6,374 cases of general paresis
were reported,&mdash;12.71 per cent of the 49,640 first admissions.
During the years 1918 and 1919 that disease constituted
13.19 per cent of all admissions. This apparent
increase undoubtedly is due to the fact that modern
methods have materially improved facilities for accuracy
of diagnosis. It is not at all probable that the admission
rate has doubled during the period in question for any
other reason. In the Massachusetts hospitals during the
year 1919, only 7.90 per cent of the first admissions were
diagnosed as general paresis. There was, however, an
unusually high rate of cerebral syphilis. In twenty-one
hospitals in fourteen other states, reports based on the
present classification show a total of 18,336 admissions,
mostly in 1917, 1918 and 1919. Of this number 1,233, or
6.72 per cent, were cases of general paresis. Thus, in a
total of 70,987 admissions based on the present classification
of psychoses as used by the American Psychiatric
Association there were 7,845 cases of general paresis in
all,&mdash;a percentage of 11.05. It is, of course, a well-known
fact that general paresis is largely a psychosis of densely
populated communities. This is readily shown by the
New York statistics. During the year 1919, 9.6 per cent
of the admissions at Binghamton were cases of general
paresis. The percentage at Buffalo was 15.5; at Gowanda,
17.3; Hudson River (Poughkeepsie), 9.0; at Middletown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
3.7; Rochester, 8.6; St. Lawrence (Ogdensburg),
9.2; Utica, 10.1; and Willard, 13. In the institutions
caring for the insane of New York City 16.3 per cent
were reported at the Manhattan State Hospital, 13.5
per cent at Kings Park, and 14.7 per cent at Central Islip.
The percentage at the other institutions, except at Buffalo
and Gowanda, which care almost entirely for residents
of the city of Buffalo, is determined very largely
by the transfer of patients from the hospitals of New
York City and the metropolitan district. General paresis
constitutes approximately ten per cent of the commitments
in the city of Boston. On the other hand, we find
an admission rate of 2.3 per cent for the Vermont State
Hospital (1917 and 1918), 1.5 per cent for the Central
State Hospital, Virginia (1919), 2.5 per cent for the
Columbia State Hospital (South Carolina) (1918), and
a period of two years at the Spencer State Hospital,
West Virginia (1917 and 1918) with 262 admissions and
no cases of general paresis. Of 2,895 first admissions reported
by the Ohio state hospitals for the year ending
June 30, 1920, 438, or 15.12 per cent, were cases of general
paresis. It is interesting, at least, to note that
Letelier<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> showed an admission rate for this disease of
seven per cent at the Casa de Orates at Santiago, Chili.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH CEREBRAL SYPHILIS</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The indications are at the present time that the psychiatry
of the future will not deal with a consideration
of general paralysis and cerebral syphilis, as such, but
will differentiate preferably between parenchymatous
and interstitial, or mesoblastic, syphilitic processes of
the nervous system. The retention of the designation
general paresis is little, if anything, more than a concession
to the claims of tradition. Cerebral syphilis may be
said in a general way at this time to include all syphilitic
involvements of the brain other than general paresis,
which must be accorded the precedence due to priority
of recognition if nothing else. In the light of
our present knowledge we may speak in rather definite
terms in considering cerebral syphilis from
the standpoint of pathology. On an anatomical basis
it is usually divided into three forms,&mdash;the meningitic,
the endarteritic and the gummatous types.
It is, of course, not to be understood that these represent
separate and distinct processes. Combined forms are
nearly always to be expected and the different types practically
always coexist more or less.</p>

<p>The onset of the disease may be expected anywhere
from one to ten or even fifteen years from the date of the
initial lesion. The early appearance of cerebral symptoms
would indicate brain syphilis as a general rule
rather than general paresis. Oppenheim<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> in his second
edition says that cerebral syphilis often develops within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
a year after infection, a majority of the cases being noted
within two years. He finds it a very rare occurrence
after ten years. "Because," as Barker<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> puts it, "of the
lawlessness of the occurrence of syphilitic lesions in the
central nervous system, all clinical classifications of these
cases are based only on the predominance of certain
associations of lesions." Certainly the pathology of the
disease is quite varied in its manifestations.</p>

<p>The meningeal form is the one most often encountered.
This may appear on the convexity or on the base
of the brain and is spoken of as being either localized
or diffuse in character. It may or may not be associated
with gummatous formations or cortical vascular involvement.
The essential process is a leptomeningitis. The
pia is thickened, opaque and adherent to the cortex. The
microscope shows the presence of inflammatory elements
consisting largely of lymphocytes and plasma cells which
may be confined entirely to the meninges or may extend
downward to the superficial cortical layers directly or
by extension along the adventitial sheaths of the vessels.
An examination of the cortex, however, shows a
limitation of this invasion to the immediate neighborhood
of the meninges. The cortical involvement, in other
words, is entirely secondary and is not the important
part of the pathological picture that it always is in general
paresis. The meningeal condition is practically the
same in the two diseases but more likely to be localized
in syphilitic processes. Dunlap<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> calls attention to the
important fact that in a group of cases occurring many
years after infection he found involvements of the deeper
cortical layers strongly suggesting general paresis pathologically
and impossible of differentiation clinically. In
these cases, even in the deep cortical vessel walls, occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
lymphoid and plasma cells were found, as well as
typical syphilitic endarteritis in some instances. There
is frequently, in addition to the simple meningeal involvement
at the base, a widespread gummatous infiltration of
the pia-arachnoid or in some instances numerous miliary
granulomas. This is especially common in the region
of the chiasm and may involve the origin of various
cranial nerves, obviously in such cases determining the
symptomatology to be expected. The optic and oculomotor
nerves particularly are affected. The large vessels
at the base are often involved either by syphilitic inflammatory
processes or by direct invasion of their
walls by gummas. An extensive specific meningo-encephalitis
may lead either to foci or extensive areas of
actual softening.</p>

<p>The endarteritis which occurs in syphilis is characteristic
and diagnostic. This has been studied exhaustively
by Heubner. The smaller vessels show an infiltration
of lymphoid and plasma cells in their adventitia, as
well as in the perivascular lymph spaces. The larger
vessels show a great thickening of the intima which is
consecutive, or, as Lambert described it, "girdling" in
character. This is associated with a splitting of the membrana
elastica. The proliferated intimal tissue is very
susceptible to degenerative processes. Thrombosis and
the formation of anemic infarctions may follow the obliteration
of the vascular channels. The involvement of
the larger vessels may lead to very distinctive focal symptoms.
Thus, as Barker<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> has pointed out, there may
be an obliterating process in the middle cerebral with
hemiplegia and aphasia, invasion of the basilar artery
with pontile or bulbar symptoms, or an involvement of
the posterior cerebral may lead to hemianesthesia or
hemianopsia, while an affection of the vertebral may
show a unilateral bulbar paralysis with hemianesthesia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of the same side and a hemiplegia of the opposite side.
The extensive involvements of the base are usually meningeal,
with gumma formation and with a secondary endarteritis
in addition. Large solitary gummata may,
moreover, occur practically anywhere in the brain, although
they are somewhat unusual. On microscopical
examination they show a characteristic infiltration of
the periphery and a caseous center. They are more
likely to occur in the course of a large vessel.</p>

<p>The symptomatology of brain syphilis necessarily
varies with the nature, extent and location of the lesion.
In the earlier stages of a diffuse meningitis the prominent
symptoms to be expected first are headache and dizziness.
In an individual with a definite specific history a persistence
of such symptoms should suggest salvarsan therapy.
Vomiting is a common complication. Cranial nerve palsies,
optic neuritis or hemiplegia in such a case would, of
course, be conclusive. Stuporous, confused or delirious
states may occur, with or without hallucinations. When
the syphilitic process is an extensive one with a widespread
meningitis or gummatous involvement of the base,
numerous focal symptoms are to be expected. Choked
disc, optic tract lesions, paralysis of the ocular muscles,
facial neuralgias, facial palsies, deafness, or anesthesias
may occur. Mental deterioration naturally advances
with the progress of the disease, but the personality is
much better preserved than in general paresis. Periods
of unconsciousness are not infrequent and convulsive attacks
may appear. These may be general or local and
paralyses often follow. These may assume the form of
a hemiplegia or may involve only certain groups of muscles.
Ptosis is often noted. Paralysis of other eye muscles
is common, and pupillary rigidity is sometimes a
symptom. Hemianopsia and diplopia are often observed:
An important feature of the disease is the fact that these
conditions are more or less transitory and rarely become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
permanent. Apoplectiform attacks followed by hemiplegia
are results of gummatous growth or may be associated
with areas of softening. These are due to vascular
disturbances. Aphasia is not an unusual occurrence.
Hemiplegias appearing suddenly in individuals under
forty years of age are likely to be of specific origin.
Epilepsies developing in later years should always be
viewed with suspicion. The Korsakow symptom complex
has been found in some cases of brain syphilis.
Memory defect is present in most instances. When a
marked mental deterioration takes place it is usually late
in the disease. Argyll-Robertson pupils are infrequent in
cerebral syphilis. Speech defect is practically never so
conspicuous as it is in general paresis. Writing difficulties
are also much less marked. Euphoria and grandiose
delusions occasionally occur in brain syphilis but much
less frequently than in general paresis. Hemiplegias,
when they occur, are much more likely to be permanent
than they are in general paresis. Paranoid complexes
are sometimes clinical features of the disease and if they
persist strongly suggest syphilis rather than paresis.</p>

<p>There should be a positive Wassermann reaction in
the blood serum of both diseases. It is more persistent,
however, in the syphilitic form. In the spinal fluid the
reverse is the case and negative results are often noted
in cerebral syphilis. There is usually some increase
sooner or later in the albumen and globulin content in
both diseases. There may be a lymphocytosis in both,
although usually much greater in general paresis. A
typical colloidal gold reaction is more indicative of general
paresis than syphilitic conditions. Several clinical
groupings have been proposed. Plant, for instance,
speaks of various forms of mental deterioration, pseudo-paresis,
paranoid types, epileptiform varieties, symptomatic
disturbances and affective reactions suggesting
manic-depressive insanity. The important contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
made by Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> to the literature of this subject is
worthy of careful study. He describes a syphilitic neurasthenia,
a mental disturbance due to the psychic effect
of the disease, and various conditions resulting from
gummatous growths. His most important group is a
syphilitic pseudo-paralysis, which he divides into a simple
dementia, delirious forms, expansive types and a variety
showing the characteristic Korsakow syndrome. He also
speaks of syphilitic apoplexies and epilepsy, tabetic psychoses
and syphilitic paranoid conditions.</p>

<p>Syphilitic neurasthenia as described by Kraepelin is
an affection which is likely to occur early in the disease
and manifest itself shortly after the initial infection. In
the milder forms, evidences of nervousness appear,&mdash;difficulty
of thought, irritability, disturbances of sleep,
pressure in the head, with indefinite and changeable abnormal
sensations and vague pains. Later, feelings of
anxiety, depression, dizziness, mental dulness, a difficulty
in finding words, transient weaknesses, disturbances of
sensation, nausea and a slight rise of temperature are observed.
He admits that there is some question as to
whether this constitutes a clinical entity and if so,
whether it is directly due to the infectious process or is
to be attributed to psychic disturbances. Nervous reactions
of various kinds are to be found in syphilitics without
psychosis. Thus, Meyer in sixty-one cases of secondary
syphilis found eighteen with sluggish pupils, thirty-two
with increased reflexes, and twelve with general
nervous manifestations such as headache, vertigo, etc.,
appearing shortly after the period of infection. In only
five of these patients were there any evidences of an
organic disease. In twelve tertiary cases he found indications
of an involvement of the nervous system in only
two. In thirty examinations following lumbar puncture
a lymphocytosis and an abnormal protein content were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
observed. Buttino, in a study of thirty syphilitics, reported
that fourteen showed a diminished light reaction
within one year of the time of infection. Later, after
unmistakable symptoms of cortical involvement have
existed for some time, neurasthenic complexes are common.
These take the form of a difficulty of thought, absentmindedness,
forgetfulness, and a reduction of interests.
The mood may be irritable, surly, depressed, anxious,
fearful, and changeable, showing at the same time
considerable indifference and dulness. Some are quiet
and reserved while others are excited and violent. Severe
headaches may be common, more often at night.
There are also occasional attacks of dizziness or fainting,
disturbances of sensation, sleeplessness, sensitiveness
to alcohol, and occasional diplopia. These are preliminary
to more severe disturbances, which simulate
nervous exhaustion, and are not strikingly unlike the
earlier stages of general paresis. They may be differentiated
by examination of the spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Another group of cases is characterized by conditions
due to an increased intracranial pressure. These are
marked by thoughtlessness, dulness, and indifference terminating
in a complete lethargy and somnolence, during
which the patient occasionally demonstrates that he is not
so badly damaged mentally as he appears. Physically
there may be weakness, twitchings, fainting spells, convulsions,
ataxias, paralyses, dysesthesias, choked disc,
etc. The basis of this disturbance is a gummatous
growth, its location, of course, largely determining the
symptoms. Kraepelin suggests the possibility of getting
this disease picture in a syphilitic as the result of a
growth of some other kind&mdash;a glioma or endothelioma.</p>

<p>Slightly more than a third of the cases encountered
in his clinic showed the symptom-complex which he describes
as syphilitic pseudo-paresis. As a rule these cases
are of the simple demented type with a general mental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
deterioration. The patients show some disturbance of
apprehension and attention, tire easily and are quite
forgetful and dull. Delirious states may supervene, with
clouding, confusion and disorientation, as well as hallucinations
of sight and hearing. Memory is markedly impaired
and confabulation may be noted. Judgment is
not so much interfered with as in paresis. The patients
have some insight into their condition and complain of
headache, difficulty of thought, etc. Occasional delusions
are observed. These may be of a hypochondriacal type
or grandiose in character. As a rule the mood is cheerful,
but it may be depressed, anxious or fearful, with suicidal
tendencies. Sleep is disturbed and there is considerable
restlessness, usually at night. With all of these
symptoms there are the physical signs of a severe cortical
involvement, dizziness, fainting spells, twitchings,
seizures or frank convulsions, occasional paralyses, etc.
Disturbance of sensation and motion may appear with
a perfectly clear consciousness at times. Aphasic symptoms
are not uncommon. The eye muscles are affected
in many cases, with ptosis, double vision, strabismus, etc.
The pupils are usually immobile or sluggish, frequently
only one being involved. The field of vision is narrowed
and choked disc is common. Speech is affected, as well
as writing. All kinds of paralyses occur and they persist
for some time. The gait may be spastic or ataxic.
The reflexes are usually increased and often different
on the two sides. Romberg's sign often appears. A
Babinski reflex and ankle clonus may be found. The
patients are usually untidy in their habits. Blood pressure
is increased in some cases and the pulse slow. There
may be variations in temperature. Often there are evidences
of old syphilitic processes on the skin surface,
enlarged glands, residuals of choroiditis, etc. Usually
Kraepelin found a positive Wassermann reaction in the
blood, but not in the spinal fluid, which showed a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
cell increase, often from fifteen to twenty per cubic millimeter,
rarely in larger numbers. He found the course
of the disease rapid, but with occasional remissions.
There may be a sudden collapse and death. It usually
terminates, however, in a profound dementia, often with
a hemiplegia and epileptiform seizures. There are other
conditions suggesting general paresis. Marcus, for instance,
has described a delirious, confusional state occurring
usually in the first year after the infection, sometimes
later, but as a rule developing suddenly. The
patients become sleepless, confused, anxious and disoriented.
Numerous hallucinations appear, both of hearing
and vision, usually of a very unpleasant type. The
patients often become excited and violent or even suicidal.
Physical signs more or less similar to those already
described are to be expected. According to
Marcus, these cases always respond to syphilitic treatment.</p>

<p>A small group of cases, as pointed out by Westphal,
shows excitements strongly simulating the expansive
type of general paresis. This form begins ordinarily
with a depression, sometimes appearing suddenly, followed
by irritability, marked restless excitement, headache,
and fainting attacks. Usually there are hallucinations,
and delusional ideas of a grandiose type. Above
all there are pupillary disturbances, increased or decreased
reflexes, seizures, paralyses, etc., strongly resembling
paresis. All of these symptoms may disappear
under syphilitic treatment in time. Some cases, however,
last for years, dying as a rule in a seizure. Kraepelin
also describes at some length a group showing the Korsakow
complex. He suggests that the fact that this condition
usually develops in alcoholics is not without
significance.</p>

<p>Kraepelin is of the opinion that the mental picture is
the conspicuous and characteristic feature of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
paresis standing out more prominently than the physical
evidences of the disease. In syphilitic pseudo-paresis, on
the other hand, there is a clearer sensorium without such
marked disorientation, and memory is not usually so
much affected. At the same time, the physical signs are
relatively more prominent, although the speech difficulty
and writing defects may not be so marked. The pupils
sometimes show no changes. Hemiplegias with ankle
clonus and a Babinski reflex are, however, disproportionately
common. The eye muscles are much more often
involved than they are in general paresis. Loss of pain
sense is not so noticeable. An advanced form of deterioration
of many years standing is against a diagnosis
of paresis and favors cerebral syphilis. In these cases
the physical signs drop somewhat into the background.
There are, nevertheless, stationary cases of general paresis
which can be differentiated with great difficulty if
at all. The development of pseudo-paresis is slower
and more irregular. After a seizure and a paralysis
there may be a long remission. The disease, furthermore,
does not, like general paresis, always terminate
in death.</p>

<p>Kraepelin finds the apoplectiform type of brain
syphilis very common. After a few premonitory symptoms
such as headache, dizziness, irritability, weakness
of memory, etc., a typical apoplexy takes place, leaving
a hemiplegia with or without a speech defect. This
sometimes occurs without any loss of consciousness.
The patient presents the appearance of an ordinary
hemiplegic with increased reflexes on one side and ankle
clonus followed by a Babinski reflex, etc. Writing is
usually affected as well as speech. There may not be
another attack for some years. There is, however, a
progressive mental deterioration. Occasional confusional
states or excitements may be met with. In the
meanwhile, numerous physical signs appear, papillary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
changes, disturbances of the reflexes, ptosis, tremors,
hemianopsia, etc. Epileptiform attacks may occur. The
blood pressure is usually quite high. There is an increase
in the cells in the spinal fluid, often with a negative Wassermann,
although the blood serum is positive. Death
usually results from a seizure. Three-fourths of Kraepelin's
cases developed before the age of forty-five, which,
of course, assists materially in the diagnosis.</p>

<p>In younger individuals usually, cerebral syphilis may
manifest itself in the form of an epilepsy. Kraepelin is
of the opinion that these conditions usually result from
endarteritic involvements. In their development they
show nothing differing in any way from an ordinary epilepsy.
The attacks are usually mild at first, gradually
increasing in severity, and are much aggravated by alcohol.
There are, however, the usual physical signs of
brain lues and later speech defects appear. There is
eventually an emotional and intellectual deterioration.
The changes in the spinal fluid are those described as
characteristic of the other form of syphilis.</p>

<p>Kraepelin describes the paranoid forms as very uncertain
in type and not so well defined. Hallucinations
and delusions play the principal part with physical disturbances
in the background. They become more or less
prominent, however, eventually. The patient is usually
anxious, restless, suspicious and develops delusions with
characteristic ideas of jealousy on a sexual basis. Full-fledged
persecutory trends also appear, usually with numerous
hallucinations. Occasionally delusions of sin and
self-accusation are noted, although ideas of grandeur
mixed with complaints of persecution are more common.
Consciousness remains undisturbed as a rule and there
is no disorientation. The mood is changeable, at times
depressed, tearful, anxious, irritable, complaining, but
often cheerful and self-satisfied. There is usually more
or less emotional dulness, with an indifference to the surroundings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
The emotional life is shallow and superficial.
Sudden excitements may occur at times with outbursts of
anger. There are usually no striking conduct disorders.
There may be occasional seizures of a mild form, fainting
attacks, dizziness, rarely epileptiform attacks or
slight apoplectiform symptoms. Sooner or later the
physical signs of brain syphilis develop. The course of
the disease is slow. Similar pictures are noted in tabes.
The therapeutic test is not to be relied upon too strongly
in making a diagnosis or differentiating between paresis
and syphilis. It must be remembered that after all we
are dealing here with one disease process. It has been
found that in many syphilitics, even in recent cases, a
positive Wassermann reaction, an increase in the cell
count or in the protein content may occasionally be demonstrated
in the spinal fluid.</p>

<p>In a study of 428 cases of neurosyphilis treated in
Boston, Raeder<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> reported that 129, or practically thirty
per cent, showed definite improvement, both physical and
mental. He did not make any extravagant claims as to
final results to be expected. "The therapia praesens
of neurosyphilis is but a transition state in rational
syphilography. Medical science has discovered several
good clues which must be followed up; and others ferreted
out and run down before the solution of the problem
is complete. Indeed the successful treatment of
paresis and tabes, as well as general vascular syphilis
and visceral tertiaries, such as the crippling cradio-pathia,
etc., may ultimately be realized in the field of preventive
medicine. With chemotherapy, however, Ehrlich
has doubtless found the most vulnerable approach to the
treponemiatic diseases, but further research is necessary
and other combinations must be found before the life of
this anthropophagus pest is successfully snuffed out."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>
<p>Warthin<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> at autopsy found evidences of active
syphilis in a series of forty-one inactive or "cured" cases
investigated by him. Eleven of these had been treated,
were supposed to have recovered and showed no syphilitic
manifestations at the time of death. Five had received
an extended course of salvarsan therapy and in twenty-five
there was no history of syphilis at all. Spirochaetes
were demonstrated by the Levaditi method in thirty-six
of the forty-one cases&mdash;in the aorta in thirty-two, in the
testes in thirty-one, in the liver in four, in the adrenals in
six, in the pancreas in six, in the spleen in one and in
the nervous system in five. In some of these cases the
Wassermann reaction was reported as negative. Warthin
concluded that cured syphilis in many if not all instances
is in a latent condition, spirochaetes of a low
virulence still remaining active.</p>

<p>For purposes of statistical study the American Psychiatric
Association has not attempted any clinical differentiation
of the various types of this disease, a procedure
which was felt to be inadvisable at this time. The following
suggestions appear in the manual as to the classification
of psychoses due to cerebral syphilis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since general paralysis itself is now known to be
a parenchymatous form of brain syphilis, the differentiation
of the cerebral syphilis cases might on theoretical
grounds be regarded as less important than formerly.
Practically, however, the separation of the non-parenchymatous
forms is very important because the symptoms,
the course and therapeutic outlook in most of these
cases are different from those of general paralysis.</p>

<p>"According to the predominant pathological characteristics,
three types of cerebral syphilis may be distinguished,
viz.: (a) Meningitic, (b) Endarteritic, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
(c) Gummatous. The lines of demarcation between these
types are not, however, sharp ones. We practically always
find in the endarteritic and gummatous types a certain
amount of meningitis.</p>

<p>"The acute meningitic form is the most frequent type
of cerebral syphilis and gives little trouble in diagnosis;
many of these cases do not reach state hospitals. In most
cases after prodromal symptoms (headache, dizziness,
etc.) there is a rapid development of physical signs, usually
cranial nerve involvement, and a mental picture of
dulness or confusion with few psychotic symptoms except
those related to a delirious or organic reaction.</p>

<p>"In the rarer chronic meningitic forms which are apt
to occur a long time after the syphilitic infection, usually
in the period in which we might expect general paralysis,
the diagnostic difficulties may be considerable.</p>

<p>"In the endarteritic forms the most characteristic
symptoms are those resulting from focal vascular lesions.</p>

<p>"In the gummatous forms the slowly developing focal
and pressure symptoms are most significant.</p>

<p>"In all forms of cerebral syphilis the psychotic manifestations
are less prominent than in general paralysis
and the personality is much better preserved as shown by
the social reactions, ethical sense, judgment and general
behavior. The grandiose ideas and absurd trends of the
general paralytic are rarely encountered in these cases."</p>

<p>It is only of comparatively late years that the hospitals
of this country have shown the frequency of psychoses
due to cerebral syphilis in their reports. Statistical studies
indicate that such mental conditions are quite unusual
as compared with other well recognized clinical entities.
In a total of 49,640 first admissions reported by the New
York state hospitals during a period of eight years
only 342, or .67 per cent, were reported as mental diseases
due to cerebral syphilis. The Massachusetts hospitals
during 1919 reported only twenty-seven cases, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
percentage of .89. Twenty-one hospitals in fourteen
other states, in a total of 18,336 admissions, showed only
124 cases (.67 per cent) of cerebral syphilis. This represents,
therefore, a total of 70,987 admissions with only
493 diagnosed as psychoses due to cerebral syphilis,&mdash;a
percentage of .69. When this is compared with eleven
per cent as shown by the admissions for general paresis
it is probably a very fair index of the comparative frequency
of the two diseases in our institutions. It is interesting
to note that the incidence of cerebral syphilis
as shown by the hospitals of the various states is almost
exactly the same. The admission rate for the Casa de
Orates in Santiago, Chili, in 1918, as shown by Letelier,
was .90 per cent.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH HUNTINGTON'S CHOREA,
BRAIN TUMOR AND OTHER BRAIN
OR NERVOUS DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Huntington's chorea is said to have been referred to
first by C. O. Waters of Franklin, N. Y., in Dunglison's
"Practice of Medicine" in 1842. An article on the subject
by Irving W. Lyon also appeared in the <i>American
Medical Times</i> in 1863. The name by which the disease
is now generally known was the result of an elaborate
description of its symptomatology by George Huntington
in the <i>Medical and Surgical Reporter</i> in 1872. He particularly
called attention to the fact that it is hereditary
in origin, occurs in adult life, is associated with suicidal
tendencies and often exhibits mental symptoms. On the
important subject of heredity Huntington made the following
observation: "If one or both of the parents have
shown manifestations of the disease, and more especially
when these manifestations have been of a serious nature,
one or more of the offspring almost invariably suffer
from the disease if they live to adult life; and if by any
chance these children get through life without it, the
thread is broken and the grandchildren or great grandchildren
may rest assured that they are free from the
disease. Unstable and whimsical as the disease may be
in other respects, in this it is firm; it never skips a generation
to manifest itself in another; as soon as it has
yielded its claims, it never regains them." A well known
monograph on the subject by Osler appeared in 1894.</p>

<p>McCarthy<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> refers to the mental condition associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
with this disease as "a severe and gradually progressive
deterioration, ultimately ending in absolute dementia.
In some cases the mental defect is noted from
the onset of the symptoms, in others the mentality may
remain unimpaired for years. Mental deterioration is
the rule, and it is associated with a loss of memory and a
tendency to self-destruction which gradually develops.
When the mental degeneration is well marked, outbreaks
of violence are sometimes noted. In one of the writer's
patients, as the disease progressed, the clinical picture
of paresis was presented. The chronic delusional state
is more often noted than would be inferred from Huntington's
description." Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> who made a clinical
study of a considerable series of cases in 1907, expressed
the opinion that mental deterioration occurs in
the majority of instances before the onset of choreiform
symptoms. He found a special tendency to deterioration
in the cases appearing early in life, while irritability and
delusional ideas were more often observed in those developing
in later years. Delusions of persecution and deterioration,
however, were symptoms more or less
common to both groups. Diefendorf,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> in a study of
twenty-eight cases in 1908, called attention particularly
to the irritability with occasional outbursts of violence as
well as attacks of despondency. He emphasizes emotional
deterioration and indifference.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> also refers to the fact that the mental
symptoms may precede the choreiform manifestations in
appearance, sometimes by a number of years. The patients
become forgetful, defective in judgment, somewhat
dull, show a poverty of thought and an incapacity for
orderly activities. Generally there is an emotional depression,
often with irritability and more rarely euphoric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
symptoms. Delusions gradually develop. These are of
a persecutory nature, although ideas of grandeur appear
at times. Suicidal tendencies are common. Disturbances
of perception and memory may be very pronounced. The
relation of the patient to his environment becomes very
much confused. In some cases, on the other hand, the
mental symptoms are not very striking. Anxious states,
outbursts of anger or emotional excitements may appear
at times. Appetite and sleep are often interfered with.
The pathology of this disease is not characteristic. There
may be a chronic meningitis or extensive atrophies. The
cells of the third layer of the cortex, according to Kraepelin,
are decreased in number with an increase of glia
nuclei. The remaining cells are shrunken with deeply
staining processes, and there is a considerable loss of
tangential fibres. Sclerotic changes with thickened walls
are noted in the blood vessels. Hyaline degeneration and
miliary hemorrhages have been observed, although Nissl
and Alzheimer found no vascular lesions worthy of note.
The cortical changes, according to Räcke, are more pronounced
in the central convolutions, being much less conspicuous
in the frontal and occipital regions. Alzheimer
found the corpus striatum particularly involved. Here
he noted a striking cell loss, with glia proliferation but
no vascular changes. D'Ormea, according to Kraepelin,
traced the disease through five generations in one family
and Browning went as far back as two hundred years in
another.</p>

<p>The observations on the subject of Huntington's
chorea in the statistical manual of the American Psychiatric
Association are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mental symptoms are a constant accompaniment of
this form of chorea and as a rule become more marked as
the disease advances. Although the disease is regarded
as being hereditary in nature, a diagnosis can be made
on the clinical picture in the absence of a family history.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"The chief mental symptoms are those of mental inertia
and an emotional change, either apathy and silliness
or a depressive irritable reaction with a tendency to passionate
outbursts. As the disease progresses the memory
is affected to some extent, but the patient's ability to
recall past events is often found to be surprisingly well
preserved when the disinclination to cooperate and give
information can be overcome. Likewise the orientation
is well retained even when the patient appears very apathetic
and listless. Suspicions and paranoid ideas are
prominent in some cases."</p>

<p>Statistical reports from American institutions show
that comparatively few cases of Huntington's chorea
are committed. In 49,640 first admissions to the New
York state hospitals only forty-eight, or .09 per cent,
were diagnosed as Huntington's chorea during a period
of eight years. The admission rate to the Massachusetts
hospitals during 1919 was exactly the same. In twenty-one
hospitals in fourteen other states twenty-four cases
(.13 per cent) in 18,336 admissions were reported as
Huntington's chorea. There were only seventy-five cases
(.1 per cent) in 70,987 admissions to forty-eight hospitals
in sixteen different states.</p>


<p class="st5"><i>Psychoses with Brain Tumor</i></p>

<p>Brain tumors are more common perhaps than is generally
understood. Cushing<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> shows that they were
found in fifty-five, or 1.7 per cent, of 3,150 autopsies at
the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He refers to Siedel, who
observed them in 1.25 per cent of his cases in Munich and
states that Blackburn found them in about two per cent
of 1,642 autopsies at the St. Elizabeths Hospital in
Washington. He also quotes Bruns as saying that two
per cent of all neurological cases show intracranial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
growths. In the first twenty-five hundred surgical conditions
admitted to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in
Boston eight per cent were diagnosed as brain tumor.
Cushing found that 66.6 per cent of 130 carefully studied
growths were gliomata. Nearly four per cent were endotheliomas.
In another series of seventy cases he found
twenty-seven gliomas (38.5 per cent), seventeen adenomas
(twenty-four per cent), seven endotheliomas (ten
per cent), five interpeduncular and mixed growths (seven
per cent), and other forms in smaller percentages. Many
of the endotheliomas have undoubtedly been included in
the past with the sarcomas. This may also be said of
gliomas.</p>

<p>According to Cushing, growths in the brain may give
rise to no disturbance whatever, show well defined focal
signs, occasion only general manifestations, or have both
general and focal symptoms, depending on the location
of the neoplasm. General symptoms may be briefly summarized
as follows:&mdash;headache, vomiting, choked disc,
vertigo, drowsiness, convulsions, disturbances of the
pulse rate, respiration and temperature, as well as mental
disorders. The focal signs depend wholly on the site
of the growth. Cushing mentions the following symptom
complex as resulting from lesions of the frontal lobes:&mdash;"Indifference,
unpunctuality, mental enfeeblement, loss
of memory and power of attention, change in disposition
with more or less marked irritability or taciturnity
or obstinacy or jocularity, etc., often a rambling speech,
lack of realization of the illness, and change in the general
conduct of life with habits of untidiness. These, in greater
or less degree, characterize most of the cases, although
it is often astonishing to find how inconspicuous the symptoms
may be with a very extensive growth. They may
often be of rather abrupt onset and not until the situation
of the lesion is definitely disclosed and careful interrogation
made into the patient's previous mental state is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
possible to learn that in all probability some mental alteration
has been of long standing."</p>

<p>Bruns did not find psychoses associated very often
with frontal lesions. Jacobi, however, in reviewing the
literature of growths in that region, found mental symptoms
in forty-nine per cent. Schuster observed them in
from fifty to sixty per cent of all brain tumors. Redlich<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
described mental conditions as being either incidental
and not related to the growth, or definitely caused
by it, and was even of the opinion that the neoplasm
could in some instances be the result of a psychosis. Two
of Redlich's patients, moderately alcoholic, showed a
typical Korsakow syndrome. He refers to the fact that
in cases reported by Oppenheim, Friedrich and Fürstner,
"Witzelsucht," or the tendency to joke, disappeared
after growths were removed from the frontal region. A
patient of Begerthal, who had hallucinations, delusions
and somatic symptoms, recovered after a tubercle was
excised from the paracentral lobule. A case of Friedrich's
which showed an alteration of the personality,
erotic symptoms, sudden explosive laughter, poor memory,
etc., recovered after a sarcoma was removed from
the right frontal lobe. A patient of Thoma's after three
attacks of mental depression showed a gliosarcoma in the
occipital lobe at autopsy. Schuster, Bruns and Schönthal
have reported cases of brain tumor with hysterical
manifestations.</p>

<p>Redlich described the psychoses associated with cerebral
growths as being epileptiform in character and origin
and resembling post-epileptic psychoses in their symptomatology,
with irritability, excitement or violence, confusion,
delirium and hallucinations, often followed by
partial amnesia. Epileptic manifestations may occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in the form of equivalents during the development of the
growth. Bernhardt and Oppenheim have called attention
to episodes of vertigo, irritability, excitement, clouding
and occasional delirium with amnesia following intense
paroxysms of headache. These attacks also strongly
suggest the characteristics of epileptic psychoses. Nothnagel,
Bernhardt, Oppenheim, Schuster, Ziehen and
others attribute the mental symptoms associated with
brain tumor to increased intracranial pressure producing
an anaemia. Klippel, Maillard, Vigouroux, Kaplan and
others believe that they are due to toxins originating
in the growth. This view is based largely on the appearance
of psychoses similar to the Korsakow syndrome.
Knapp in 1906 called attention to the prominence of
mental symptoms in growths occurring in the anterior
portion of the corpus callosum. These may be associated
with intellectual defects, apraxia, speech disturbances
and stupor. Gianelli found mental disturbances in 209
of 318 cases examined.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> attributes the mental symptoms of
growths to an injury of the brain structure, changes in
intracranial pressure, circulatory disturbances, and the
absorption of toxic substances. A growth of considerable
size but of slow development may permit of a readjustment
of pressure, etc., and show few symptoms. On the
other hand, a small neoplasm on account of its site or
rapidity of growth may be accompanied by profound
mental disturbances resulting from chemical irritation,
obstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius, or circulatory
interferences. Kraepelin quotes Schuster (1902) as finding
psychotic symptoms in all cases of growths in the
corpus callosum, in two-thirds of those of the hypophysis,
in one-third of those of the cerebellum and in one-fourth
of the cases with involvement of the brain stem. These
he looks upon as pressure symptoms except in the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of the callosal neoplasms. Schuster was of the opinion
that growths in the cortex usually lead to actual psychoses
and those in the deeper areas to dementia. He
found a general mental deterioration in 423 out of a total
of 775 cases of brain tumor. The patients were indolent,
inattentive, clumsy, forgetful, dull, tired easily and lost
more and more their capacity and inclination for sustained
exertion. Thought, decision and mental processes
generally, required an unusual amount of effort. The
patients usually became somewhat confused and disoriented
in regard to time, place and person, as well as incoherent
in speech. In many cases there is a marked
memory disturbance with a tendency to fabrication suggesting
Korsakow's psychosis. Delirious states with
hallucinations sometimes accompany growths in the posterior
lobes. Kraepelin has also observed hallucinations
in cases with tumor of the cerebellum. Many develop
hypochondriacal ideas, others have delusions of persecution
or self-accusation and suicidal tendencies. Rarely
there are delusions of grandeur. The mood is usually
anxious, depressed and at times irritable or apathetic.
Occasionally the patients may, on the other hand, be
cheerful in spite of the hopeless condition they are in.
They may even show distractibility, flight of ideas, volubility
and excitement. There is more often a childish
elation with a tendency to joking and facetiousness.
Schuster found this more common in frontal involvements.
Kraepelin also called attention to restlessness
and excitements often leading to violence. This may
alternate with mental dulness and cataleptic states. The
patients may repeat words and make meaningless response
to questions, strongly suggesting katatonia. Mental
dulness becomes more and more marked, however,
even reaching a stuporous stage. To this is added, according
to the location of the growth, focal symptoms of
various kinds&mdash;headache, disturbance of vision, seizures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
paralyses, aphasia, agraphia, articulatory disturbance,
ataxia, etc. Special symptoms arise where psychogenic
factors play a part,&mdash;excitements with paralyses or disturbance
of perception, etc. Hysterical stigmata may
appear. Cases with growths in the frontal region occasionally
simulate general paresis but should be distinguished
without difficulty.</p>

<p>The Association's statistical manual has the following
to say of psychoses with brain tumor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A large majority of brain tumor cases show definite
mental symptoms. Most frequent are mental dullness,
somnolence, hebetude, slowness in thinking, memory failure,
irritability and depression, although a tendency to
facetiousness is sometimes observed. Episodes of confusion
with hallucinations are common; some cases express
suspicions and paranoid ideas.</p>

<p>"The diagnosis must rest in most cases on the neurological
symptoms, and these will depend on the location,
size and rate of growth of the tumor. Certain general
physical symptoms due to an increased intracranial pressure
are present in most cases, viz.: headache, dizziness,
vomiting, slowing of the pulse, choked disc and interlacing
of the color fields."</p>

<p>The number of cases reaching hospitals for mental
diseases is, of course, small. In 49,640 first admissions
to the New York state hospitals in eight years there were
sixty-seven cases (.14 per cent) of psychoses with brain
tumor. In 18,336 admissions to twenty-one hospitals in
fourteen other states there were eighteen cases (.09 per
cent) diagnosed as psychoses with brain tumor. There
were ninety-three cases (.13 per cent) in 70,987 first admissions
to forty-eight hospitals for mental diseases in
sixteen different states.</p>

<p class="st5"><i>Psychoses with Other Brain or Nervous Diseases</i></p>

<p>Cerebral hemorrhages, thrombosis and embolism are
more or less intimately associated etiologically, pathologically
and clinically. They all bear a rather definite
relation to the general question of arteriosclerosis and
may all lead to cerebral softening. Apoplexy is a term
which was employed by Aristophanes, Demosthenes and
Sophocles and has been in general use for centuries. It
was known to Chaucer and was referred to in Shakespeare's
works ("Henry IV"). It was studied very
elaborately by Sydenham and many other early writers.
Charcot and Bouchard in 1864 called attention to the
relation existing between miliary aneurysms of the cerebral
vessels and hemorrhages. In a study of the cerebral
vascular lesions at the University College Hospital, London,
Jones (<i>Brain</i>, 1905) found records of one hundred
and sixty cases occurring during a period of sixty-five
years. Of these, 123 showed hemorrhages; twenty-four,
thrombosis; and thirteen were due to embolism.</p>

<p>Thomas<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> states that: "The symptoms following
acute vascular lesions of the brain, whether the process
be the rupture of a vessel or its occlusion, are in many
respects identical; and clinically it is often impossible to
determine which process has been effective." He calls
attention to the fact that in thrombosis the final closure
of a vessel may occur suddenly and the symptoms develop
with great rapidity. On the other hand, the rupture of
a vessel may mean the escape of only a small quantity
of blood and after an embolism the circulation is not
always stopped immediately. In an analysis of 401 apoplectic
attacks Thomas found no loss of consciousness in
202 cases, although it was interrupted or markedly disturbed
in 199. Jones found a complete loss of consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
in 47.7 per cent of 201 cases of cerebral embolism
and a partial disturbance in sixty per cent. He reported
consciousness affected in seventy-five per cent of his cases
of cerebral hemorrhage and in 45.5 per cent of those of
thrombosis. When it occurs it is usually not the initial
symptom in his experience, being preceded by headache,
vertigo, weakness in certain parts of the body, etc. An
analysis of the cases of embolism reported by Virchow,
however, showed a sudden loss of consciousness as the
initial symptom to be the general rule. Gowers is of
the opinion that an initial softening is a more common
occurrence than hemorrhage.</p>

<p>In the young, apoplectic attacks are usually due to
cerebral softening, thrombosis following acute disease
or embolism resulting from endocarditis. Between the
ages of twenty and forty apoplexies usually mean syphilitic
thrombosis. In the later decades of life, either
hemorrhage, thrombosis, embolism or softening may
occur. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> collected from various hospitals,
statistics of 840 cases. Of these, 499 showed hemorrhages
and 341 softenings. He is of the opinion that the presence
of premonitory symptoms for some days indicate
thrombosis, while shorter prodromal periods point to
a hemorrhage. Rapidly developing coma suggests hemorrhage,
while a widespread paralysis without much disturbance
of consciousness is more common in thrombosis.
A marked fall of temperature and rise of blood pressure
as a rule means a hemorrhage. Repeated convulsions
are more often associated with softening or embolism.
If the symptoms indicate a capsular lesion it
favors hemorrhage, and if of a cortical type, softenings
are more likely. A positive Wassermann reaction suggests
thrombosis or softening. The presence of endocarditis
with heart murmurs points to embolism. Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
finds that, while the patient may recover from either
of these conditions without apparent intellectual defect,
he is liable to be petulant, emotional, depressed and tire
easily.</p>

<p>In psychoses following hemorrhage, thrombosis and
embolism Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> as a rule finds very little relation
between the nature of the lesion in question and the
symptoms to be expected. Immediately following the
seizure the patients become dull, clouded, confused and
disoriented, and peculiar in their behavior. This is followed
by an active excitement with loud cries, resistiveness
and struggling. These acute disturbances usually
subside, leaving, however, evidences of the arteriosclerosis
or syphilitic endarteritis which caused the hemorrhage
or thrombosis. Embolism may leave an apparently
permanent mental deterioration with aphasic and paraphasic
manifestations which often entirely clear up. In
lesions of younger persons due to syphilis, mental enfeeblement
may follow.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the psychoses accompanying paralysis
agitans is very inadequate. The disease was first
fully described by Parkinson in an English publication
in 1817, although, according to Camp, similar cases were
reported by Schwarz in 1766. The etiology of this condition
is unknown and the pathology is not at all definite.
It seems to be the rather general opinion of neurologists
that mental disturbances are quite rare in Parkinson's
Disease. Camp,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> for instance, has the following to
say on this subject:&mdash;"Mental conditions have also been
described, but usually the patient's mind is entirely clear.
In the very old the changes incident to senility, such as
irritability, childishness, etc., insomnia and memory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
changes, might be expected and may require special treatment.
Often these patients are emotionally unstable and
spells of forced weeping or laughter occur." Krafft-Ebing
refers to mental weakness in paralysis agitans and
speaks of the frequency of melancholia with hallucinations
and suicidal impulses occurring intermittently and
appearing with exacerbations of the disease. He speaks
of premature senility as playing the most important
etiological rôle. McCarthy<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> expresses the opinion
that: "Beyond a tendency on the part of some patients
to adopt a whining and complaining manner, the mind
remains very clear; in fact, the good nature and complaisance
of most of the patients, in spite of the severity
of the symptoms, is a matter of common observation.
Dementia may, however, complicate a case of the disease."
On the other hand, Parant, a French writer who
made an elaborate study of this subject in 1883, described
three distinct varieties of mental disturbance observed
by him. In the milder cases he found changes in the
personality. This is shown by irritability, egotism, restlessness,
suspicion, undue sensitiveness regarding their
disease, mild persecutory ideas, tendencies to depression,
indifference and apathy. The second class of cases described
included mental deterioration with difficulty of
thought, loss of memory, etc. The third group includes
definite psychoses characterized generally by depressions
with or without hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations
of sight are said to be common. Delusions of persecution
are prominent and hypochondriacal and somatic
ideas frequently occur. Suicidal tendencies are very pronounced.
According to Ball, these episodes come and go
"with the aggravation of the sensory symptoms, and
they seem to disappear when the tremor decreases or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
ceases entirely." The usual tendency in these cases, as
shown by Parant, is to terminate in complete deterioration.</p>

<p>Of the inflammatory conditions of the meninges
Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> makes special reference to mental disturbances
associated with tuberculosis. The patient is depressed,
anxious, irritable and apathetic, often with the
first appearance of the disease. Dulness and memory
disturbances become more and more apparent. The patient
soon becomes clouded and disoriented, confused and
delirious. Occasionally hallucinations appear. The disturbance
of consciousness becomes more and more
marked. The patient becomes incoherent, restless, noisy
and often violent. The excitement may reach the stage
of an actual mania with delirious confusion. Sometimes
the symptoms are strongly suggestive of katatonia. In
alcoholics a condition very similar to delirium tremens
develops, terminating as a rule in stupor and coma.
Speech disturbance, aphasia, convulsions, hyperesthesia
or muscular weakness may be observed in such cases.
Other forms of meningitis are quite similar but more
rapid in development and of shorter duration. In some
instances, as after epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis,
states of mental enfeeblement may follow the disease.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that our information on the subject
of multiple sclerosis is far from being complete. In
a discussion of the mental symptoms accompanying this
condition, Henderson<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> expressed the following views:&mdash;"Cases
of disseminated sclerosis which present definite,
well marked psychoses are extremely rare. When
mental symptoms do occur, they usually come on when
the condition is well advanced, the most common symptoms
are mild euphoria, labile mood, apathy and dullness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and a slightly defective memory. In some cases, however,
depression has been described as the outstanding
feature, while hallucinations of sight and hearing are
not uncommon accompaniments. In certain cases the
mental symptoms may come on early, and these are usually
of excessive severity and are rapidly followed by
complete dementia." Dunlap has described cases associated
with general paresis and showing the characteristic
lesions of both diseases at autopsy. According to
Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> mental disturbances sometimes appear before
physical symptoms are observed. These take the
form of depression, anxiety, fear, with occasional deliria,
hysterical manifestations, emotional dulness, variable
moods and a marked irritability. Later in the disease
more marked euphoric or depressive tendencies appear,
with excitements and confusional states. Delusions of a
persecutory nature, or ideas of grandeur may be observed.
Hallucinations are infrequent. According to
Kraepelin, from ten to thirty per cent of the cases terminate
in a general mental enfeeblement which is not
usually of an advanced degree. He also describes a lobar
cortical sclerosis with much more marked mental disturbances
suggesting dementia praecox.</p>

<p>Various mental conditions have been attributed to
tabes. Sachs<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> speaks of depressions and neurasthenic
conditions with irritability as a special symptom.
He has observed paranoid states and manic attacks, sometimes
with periods of "transitory dementia" with or
without aphasia. He also expresses the opinion that
tabetics may develop all of the symptoms of general paresis,
although he says that the coexistence of the two diseases
is rare. Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> speaks of milder forms of
psychoses characterized by uncertainty of memory, fatigability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and emotional instability. Many cases exhibit a
hopeless, gloomy attitude with depression and fears, or
they may be surly, irritable and quarrelsome. Others
show a surprisingly good humor. The emotional disturbances
often suggest general paresis. Kraepelin, however,
describes the characteristic psychosis of locomotor
ataxia as assuming a paranoid form and quotes Meyer as
reporting paranoic conditions in twenty-six tabetics and
depressions of various types in fourteen. He also speaks
of hallucinatory excitements resembling alcoholic conditions.
These are characterized by a sudden anxiety
and restlessness with hallucinations of both hearing and
vision. The patients complain of poisoning and sensations
of electricity, but are cheerful in mood and well
oriented. This condition may last for weeks or months,
ending in a sudden recovery, often with relapses. Shorter
hallucinatory delirious states resembling crises are also
referred to by Kraepelin. More chronic conditions are
noted, with hallucinations, persecutory delusions and
ideas of grandeur. Delirium tremens, manic-depressive
attacks, katatonia or senile psychoses may be associated
with tabes.</p>

<p>The literature of medicine contains many references
to acute chorea. It was referred to, according to Paton,
by Plat as early as 1614 and was discussed by Sydenham
at some length. Wharton Sinkler, in describing chorea
in Pepper's "System of Medicine" in 1886, made the
following interesting remarks on the mental changes involved:&mdash;"The
child is irritable and feverish, cries and
laughs readily, or is sullen and morose. Sometimes he is
violent to those about him but this is rare. Intellectually
the patient suffers somewhat. He is not able to study
as before, and the memory may be impaired. Sometimes
there is a mild form of dementia." Burr<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> divides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
these conditions into four groups:&mdash;"First (and this includes
the vast majority), patients in whom there is peevishness,
fretfulness, some loss of the power of fixing the
attention, and a slight loss of the moral sense shown by
disobedience and selfishness. Second, those showing in
addition to the above symptoms, night terrors, and transitory,
visual, auditory, or other hallucinations. Third,
those with distinct delirium, wild or mild, accompanied
with fever. Fourth (and this group is very small when
we remember how common chorea is), those showing
stupor, or rather stupidity, and an acute dementia, which
may follow the condition described under three, or appear
without any preceding mental symptoms at all severe,
and which is usually accompanied with trouble on
articulation not caused by choreic movements of the lips
and tongue, but the result of mental hebetude." White<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
refers to the irritability and emotional instability of
choreics and describes a psychosis in "chorea insaniens"
characterized by an acute confusion, sometimes of a violent
type with hallucinations, or a paranoic condition with
delusions of persecution. This may develop into a stuporous
state. Kraepelin describes the psychotic manifestations
of acute chorea as forms of delirium due to
infection with characteristic states of clouding, confusion,
etc. Wechsler has expressed similar views.</p>

<p class="p2b">Encephalitis lethargica is a disease which has received
a great deal of attention during the last few years. The
term was first applied by von Economo<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> to a series
of cases observed by him in Vienna in 1917, although, as
he has pointed out, similar epidemics occurred as early
as in 1712. This condition is characterized particularly
by lethargy, facial and oculomotor paralyses and a rise
of temperature. Cases were reported from England
and France by various observers in 1918 and by Pothier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Neal and others in this country in 1919. It has been suggested
frequently that the disease is in some way associated
with influenza. The pathological findings have
also been confused with the African sleeping sickness due
to trypanosomes. After such prodromal symptoms as
headache, malaise and drowsiness with muscular weakness
for a few days, a lethargic or stuporous state usually
develops, interrupted occasionally by delirious attacks.
Ptosis has been reported, sometimes with immobility of
the pupils. Paralyses of the facial and eye muscles are
very common. Buzzard and Greenfield<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> after a review
of twenty-two cases suggested the following symptomatological
classification:&mdash;1. Cases characterized by hemiplegia,
hemianesthesia, hemianopsia, etc.; 2. Cases characterized
by symptoms resembling those of paralysis
agitans:&mdash;the basal ganglia group; and 3. Cases characterized
by a disturbance of the cranial nerve functions.
In a publication issued recently by the United
States Public Health Service the various types of the disease
were summarized as follows:&mdash;1. A clinical affection
of the third pair of nerves; 2. Affections of the brain
stem and bulb; 3. Affections of the long tracts; 4. The
ataxic type; 5. Affections of the cerebral cortex; 6.
Cases with evidence of spinal cord involvement; and 7.
The polyneuritic type with involvement of the peripheral
nerves. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health
has recently recommended the use of the MacNulty classification,
which is quite similar in some <span class="no-break">respects:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ph3a">1. Symptoms of a general nature referable to the central
nervous system with no localizing signs.</p>

<p class="ph3a">2. General symptoms with third nerve paralysis.</p>

<p class="ph3a">3. General symptoms with localizing signs of facial
paralysis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<p class="ph3a">4. General symptoms with localizing signs extending
down to the cord.</p>

<p class="ph3a">5. General symptoms with polyneuritic involvements.</p>

<p class="ph3a">6. Mild and abortive cases.</p>

<p class="noindent">Autopsies have shown meningeal and cortical congestion,
degeneration of the nerve cells, and thickening of
the vessels with endothelial proliferation of the glia.
Venous thrombosis and multiple hemorrhages also occur.
In a study of the cerebrospinal fluid Boveri<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> found
the pressure slightly greater in many cases with an increase
in the albumen and globulin content and a mild
lymphocytosis in occasional cases. The findings are not
characteristic or of great diagnostic value. Efforts to
isolate the organism responsible for this disease have
so far been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The mental symptoms associated with encephalitis
lethargica have been studied recently by Abrahamson<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.
He finds that the patient can be aroused from the
initial lethargy and responds quickly and coherently to
questions, relapsing again into an apparent sleep. Some
irritability is shown. The attitude "expresses a desire
to be left alone." If the somnolence disappears it is usually
followed by a period of depression. The patient
complains of weariness and inability to sleep. Choreic
manifestations sometimes occur. The somnolence may
terminate, on the other hand, in a profound stupor resembling
a drug intoxication with a restless delirium.
Even then the patient can be roused momentarily. Responses
are automatic with no evidences of emotional
disturbance. Flexibilitas cerea is often present. This
condition may be followed by a period of confusion, disorientation
and amnesia suggesting Korsakow's disease.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
There is usually a period of mental depression with poverty
of thought. Occasional hallucinations were also
observed.</p>

<p>An exceedingly important contribution to the literature
of encephalitis lethargica is an analysis recently
made of the symptoms shown in eighteen cases by Kirby
and Davis.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> "The psychic disturbances of epidemic
encephalitis present the general characteristics of an
acute organic type of mental reaction, corresponding
more specifically to a toxic-infectious psychosis. In the
acute stages of the disease, psychic torpor and delirium
are the most frequently observed mental disturbances although
other clinical pictures may be encountered, as the
Korsakoff syndrome or more complex mental disorders
in which various affective and trend reactions give a
special cast to the psychotic disturbance." They report
two types of sleep disturbance, hypersomnia and hyposomnia.
The former is characterized by drowsiness,
lethargy, stupor or coma, depending entirely on the degree
reached. In the latter the patient is sleepless at
night and somnolent during the daytime. Usually delirium
was present at some time in both types of the disease.
Often there was a brief period showing a mild depression
or anxiety, following lethargy or delirium. Euphoria
was observed in a number of instances. In the
unrecovered cases they often found residuals&mdash;"depressive
affects, emotional elevations, irritability, explosive
reactions, stubbornness, apathy, etc." Their findings
may be summarized perhaps in the statement that "definitely
formulated and persistent trends are infrequent in
epidemic encephalitis ... we have found much evidence
of persisting emotional alteration with little evidence of
organic mental defects or dementia."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>
<p>A review of the statistics of American institutions
shows that psychoses associated with brain and nervous
diseases other than Huntington's chorea and brain tumor,
which have already been discussed, are exceedingly
rare. The percentage of cases reported in the New York
hospitals was .95, in the Massachusetts institutions, 1.02,
and in twenty-one other hospitals only 1.56. In a total
of 70,987 first admissions there were only 787 cases (1.1
per cent). The relative frequency of the various forms
is illustrated by the statistics of the admissions to the
New York state hospitals during a period of eight years.
Of 462 cases, 160 were diagnosed as psychoses due to
cerebral embolism; twelve, to meningitis; twenty, to
multiple sclerosis; thirty-eight, to tabes; thirty-four, to
acute chorea; and 163, to other conditions not specified.
These figures are astonishing when the fact that 49,640
patients were admitted during that time is taken into consideration.</p>

<span class="st">THE ALCOHOLIC PSYCHOSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>According to Tuke,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> one of the oldest of the Egyptian
papyri in the British Museum (Papyrus Sallier I)
makes the following very interesting reference to alcoholism:&mdash;
"Whereas it has been told me that thou hast
forsaken books, and devoted thyself to pleasure; that
thou goest from tavern to tavern, smelling of beer, at the
time of evening. If beer gets into a man it overcomes
his mind.... Thou knowest that wine is an abomination,
that thou hast taken an oath that thou wouldst not put
liquor into thee. Hast thou forgotten thy resolution?"
It is difficult to realize that this refers to one of the earliest
periods of recorded history. Hebrew, Greek and
Roman literature are prolific in equally significant testimonials
to the antiquity of alcohol as an intoxicant. It
was referred to at considerable length by Aristotle,
Plutarch and Hippocrates. That Haslam appreciated
the important relation existing between alcoholism and
mental disorders is shown by the following comment on
this subject written in 1808:&mdash;"Thus a man is permitted
slowly to poison and destroy himself; to produce a state
of irritation, which disqualifies him from any of the useful
purposes of life; to squander his property among the
most worthless and abandoned; to communicate a loathsome
and disgraceful disease to a virtuous wife; to leave
an innocent and helpless family to the meagre protection
of the parish. If it be possible the law ought to define
the circumstances under which it becomes justifiable to
restrain a human being from effecting his own destruction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and involving his family in misery and ruin. When
a man suddenly bursts through the barriers of established
opinion; if he attempts to strangle himself with a cord,
to divide his large blood vessels with a knife, or swallow
a vial full of laudanum, no one entertains any doubt about
his being a proper subject for the superintendence of
keepers; but he is allowed, without control, by a gradual
process, to undermine the fabric of his health and destroy
the property of his family."</p>

<p>Curiously enough the word alcohol is of Arabic origin
and was employed originally to describe a powder used
in applications to the eyebrows for cosmetic purposes.
It was subsequently used for centuries as referring to a
fine powder of any kind, as is shown by the writings of
Paracelsus and others. The chemical composition of alcohol
was not known until 1808, when it was described
by Lavoisier. On the other hand, Salvatori in 1817 and
Hufeland in 1818 referred to dipsomania as a disorder
due to alcoholism. Esquirol, Trélat and other early writers
included it in the "partial" insanities. Morel described
it as an impulsive form of "délire émotif" and
looked upon it as an hereditary condition. It has been
classified with the periodical insanities and even as a
form of melancholia. Magnan saw in it an episode of the
insanity of degeneracy. Magnus Huss was responsible
for the introduction of the term "chronic alcoholism" as
descriptive of a pathological condition in 1852.</p>

<p>It is said that Caelius Aurelianus protested against
the use of intoxicants in the treatment of the insane.
Notwithstanding this early reference to a question of
such importance, and the inauguration of the great temperance
crusade which began in 1808, it has been shown
by Tuke<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> that alcoholic beverages were issued in a
routine way to patients and employees of the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
asylums for the insane less than forty years ago.
"Thirty superintendents hold that they have observed
very beneficial results from the course pursued. The improvement
usually refers not only to the patients, but to
the discipline of the asylum." The cost of beer supplied
to the inmates at the Glamorgan Asylum at one time was
reported to be as high as two hundred and sixty pounds
per year (Tuke). Beer was not discontinued as a regular
article of diet for patients at the Derby Asylum until
1884.</p>

<p>In 1844 Flemming<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> in his classification of psychoses
mentioned the following forms of alcoholic insanity:&mdash;
Ferocitas et morositas ebriosorum, anoësia e potu,
anoësia semisomnis, delirium tremens, and mania à potu.
Clouston<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> described acute and chronic forms&mdash;mania
à potu, dipsomania, alcoholic dementia and degeneration.
Krafft-Ebing<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> speaks of hallucinations of the inebriate,
delirium tremens, alcoholic melancholia, mania gravis
potatorum, hallucinatory insanity, alcoholic paranoia,
alcoholic paralysis and epilepsy. Delirium tremens he
ascribes either to repeated excesses (à potu nimio),
abstinence (à potu intermisso), insufficient nourishment,
violent emotions, pneumonia and other acute diseases,
loss of sleep, injuries such as fractures, etc. By hallucination
of the inebriate (sensuum fallacia ebriosa) he refers
to the transitory hallucinations of the constant drinker.
Meyer<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> has described an alcoholic constitution "as
shown by the lachrymose, prevaricating, jealous deterioration
of the drinker."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Stöcker,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> after an extended study of a considerable
number of cases, came to the conclusion that alcoholism
is the result of a constitutional condition but not
the cause of characteristic psychoses. Often, as was also
shown by Bonhöffer, it is to be attributed to a psychopathic
personality either acquired or congenital. The
psychoses represented by the group of patients he examined
included manic-depressive insanity, dementia
praecox, hysteria, epilepsy and other miscellaneous conditions.
He refers to dipsomania as an epileptic equivalent.
His conclusions in brief were as follows:&mdash;"Chronic
alcoholism in the first place is a symptom of a mental disease.
It may, however, so exaggerate stationary epilepsy,
chronic mania, dementia praecox, etc., which hitherto
were latent, and perhaps would remain still latent
without alcoholic abuses, that it may lead to a sudden
outbreak of a turbulent disease manifestation. It may
also give these diseases peculiar traits or a peculiar
coloring for some time, which above all, may appear as
the most striking phenomena, and thus cover up the symptoms
of the fundamental disorder. Furthermore, it may,
also, on the basis of this constitutional disease give rise
to independent clinical pictures." Karpas<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> in commenting
on this says: "One must remember that cravings
play important rôles in our mental life. Some of
our cravings are gratified; others find realization in our
dreams; still others are repressed and compensated. In
fact, our mental life is nothing but a readjustment, of
complex reactions. The poet finds recourse in his phantasies;
the philosopher gives vent to his theoretical speculations;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the scientist resorts to his inventions and hypothetical
theories; the well balanced, normal individual
seeks readjustment in healthy activities,&mdash;art, literature,
science, occupations, sport, etc., etc. But the individual
with a poorly endowed constitution finds refuge in neurosis,
psychosis, alcoholism, drugs, and other vicious habits.
We must recognize that alcoholism is nothing but a compensation
for a complex, the fulfillment of which was
denied by reality."</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> described acute and chronic alcoholism,
pathological intoxication, alcoholic jealousy, delirium
tremens, Korsakow's psychosis, alcoholic hallucinoses,
paralysis and pseudo-paresis. In acute intoxication
Kraepelin finds an inhibition of apprehension, mental
grasp and the elaboration of outer impressions with a
stimulation of the release of volitional impulses. A clouding
of consciousness develops, associated with emotional
excitement and a weakness of will power. Perception
and mental reactions are delayed and their accuracy decreased
on mental tests. The discrimination between
louder sounds is uncertain, although the sensitiveness
to lighter sound impressions is increased as in the ether
narcosis. Busch found a limitation of the field of vision.
The preservation of memory impressions is imperfect.
A solution of mathematical problems shows a lowered
mental capacity for work. The association of ideas and
composition of sentences is delayed. There is a tendency
to new word formation, phrasing and rhyming, with a
certain amount of distractibility. Goal ideas are often
missed, and consistent, orderly thought is not possible.
Expression is rapid and impulsive, and is often characterized
by a loud tone of voice.</p>

<p>After larger amounts of alcohol psychomotor activities
are interfered with as shown by the writing, and
ataxia appears. The reflexes show an increased muscular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
tension. Physical strength is markedly lowered, although
it may be increased for a very short time. Alcohol
even in small amounts interferes with productive mental
processes. Ideas lose in clearness and sharpness, fatigue
occurs earlier and efficiency and judgment are impaired.
Still larger amounts retard apprehension and comprehension
and the intoxicated person no longer knows what
is said to him. All ability to control his conduct is lost.
There is a tendency to repetition in speech, rhyming and
jargon. Capacity for mental work is finally entirely gone
and memory becomes confused. Psychomotor stimulation
and excitement appear early, terminating finally in
weakness. Emotional trends, at first happy and cheerful,
are usually irritable, later with outbursts of anger.
Sexual excitement often appears. Various physical disturbances
have been described.</p>

<p>In the pathological or complicated intoxications as
described by Kraepelin, unusual emotional disturbances
such as violent excitements occur. Anger or anxiety may
develop with a clouding of the consciousness, and lead
to uncontrollable rages with impulses to assault and kill.
The most marked excitements occur in epileptics. The
outburst is usually sudden in these cases and is followed
by the most senseless and unjustifiable acts. Occasionally
suicide is the result. In hysterical and psychopathic individuals
alcohol may cause serious emotional disturbances,
with clouding of consciousness or even delusion formation.
Chronic drinkers are very likely to have abnormal
symptoms at times. They often show a marked irritability
followed by a pathetic and tearful mood. Abusive
treatment of members of the family, jealousy, threats
and violence are not uncommon. Delirious or anxious
states with persecutory ideas and hallucinations are
sometimes observed. These may exist only during intoxication.
Alcohol often produces extreme excitements
in cases of manic-depressive insanity, general paresis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
and dementia praecox. Pathological changes of various
kinds have been reported. In acute alcoholism Nissl
found a destruction of cortical cells in some cases and a
disappearance of the stainable lumps in others. The
nuclei of the neurones were shrunken and sometimes displaced.</p>

<p>Various tests have demonstrated the limited mental
capacity of the chronic alcoholic. Will power is greatly
reduced and fatigability increased. Memory and attention
are affected and falsification of the past may occur.
The patient learns nothing new and forgets the important
things. All productive efficiency is gone and interest is
lost. Weakness of judgment and loss of memory capacity
lead to delusion formation. These often take the
form of ideas of jealousy. Delusions of persecution,
poisoning or grandeur may appear from time to time.
Frequently there are genuine hallucinations. Some cases
terminate finally in mental enfeeblement. Emotional
changes are common in the chronic drinkers. The alcoholic
humor is characteristic. The capacity for taking
things seriously has been lost and there is a tendency to
undue levity, often with a marked feeling of self-satisfaction.
Some individuals, however, become moody, irritable
or dull. Occasionally anxious states appear,
frequently with suicidal attempts. One of the common
symptoms of this condition is an extraordinary
irritability after drinking. This leads to quarrels, assaults
and violence. Consideration for others is completely
lost. These attacks are often followed by remorse.
A prominent and significant feature of the disease is the
marked moral deterioration. All affection for family and
children may be lost. Selfishness is pronounced and the
patient spends all of his money for drink. Sexual excitement
is sometimes an important symptom. With all
of this there is a constant craving for alcohol. The patients
have no insight into their condition and attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
their headache and tremors to overexertion, etc. They
always deny using much alcohol and are absolutely untruthful
on this subject. Overwork necessitates drinking,
or it only happens after a death in the family, etc. Will
power deteriorates rapidly. These individuals often
commit crimes and come into conflict with the law. Gastritis,
cirrhosis of the liver and numerous other diseases
complicate the situation. Dizzy spells and headaches are
common, as well as tremors of the tongue and fingers.
Neurotic involvements are noted, with anesthesias, hyperesthesias,
paresthesias, and muscular atrophies as
well as speech defects. Epileptiform attacks are not
infrequent in chronic alcoholism, and were found in ten
per cent of Kraepelin's cases. His investigations showed
that eleven per cent of the beer drinkers in Munich had
convulsions. Combinations of epilepsy and hysterical
manifestations with chronic alcoholism are not at all
unusual. Rybakoff found a hereditary taint in 66.6 per
cent of his cases while Moli reported only forty-seven
per cent. Heredity was found to be a factor in thirty-seven
per cent of Kraepelin's Heidelberg cases and in
seventeen per cent of those at Munich. He describes
various pathological findings in chronic alcoholism. Meningitis
with hemorrhagic membranes is common. The
convolutions are atrophied and the ependyma of the
ventricles thickened. Pigmentary deposits similar to
those of senility are found in the cells and vessel walls.
There is an increase of both neuroglia cells and fibres.
Hemorrhages are occasionally found in the central gray
matter.</p>

<p>When the suspicions of the chronic alcoholic lead to
well defined delusions Kraepelin speaks of "alcoholic
jealousy" as constituting a distinct psychosis. The patient
sees in almost everything evidences of infidelity
on the part of his wife and is often inclined to question
the legitimacy of his own children. Assaults and violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
are frequent occurrences. Occasionally genuine
hallucinations accompany this condition. Suicidal and
homicidal attempts are not uncommon.</p>

<p>The onset of delirium tremens, first described by
Thomas Sutton in 1813, is characterized by states of
anxiety, fear, insomnia with disturbing dreams, sensory
excitement, hyperesthesias, flashes of light, etc. The
development usually is sudden, with a loss of attention,
disturbance of apprehension, restlessness, distractibility,
numerous hallucinations of the different senses, illusions,
clouded states with disorientation, tremors and ataxia.
Touch, pain and temperature sensations, according to
Kraepelin, are undisturbed. The field of vision is sometimes
narrowed. Recognition of colors is uncertain.
There is a marked disturbance of the equilibrium, suggesting
some lesion either of the eye muscles or of the
labyrinth. A decided lengthening of the reaction time
in associations has been shown by various observers.
Sensory hallucinations are common. The ability to read
correctly is entirely lost and what is read is meaningless.
A paraphasic form of reading has been described by Bonhöffer.
The attention cannot be held for any length of
time. A dreamy clouded state is characteristic. Disorientation
is usually complete in the severe cases. The
hallucinations and illusions are very marked and sometimes
even suggest moving pictures to the patient. Hallucinations
of vision are more common than those of
hearing. Peculiar skin sensations such as feelings of
electricity are spoken of. Hallucinations may be induced
by pressure on the eyeball and sometimes by suggestion.
There is occasionally a confusional form of speech suggesting
dementia praecox, with a tendency to coin new
words and employ entirely meaningless terms. Although
consciousness is not always entirely clouded, events transpire
as in a dream, always confused by innumerable hallucinations.
An occupation delirium is common, the patient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
imagining himself busy at his customary work.
Delusional ideas regarding everything in his surroundings
are frequent. Ideas of grandeur sometimes occur.
Never, according to Bonhöffer, is there a complete disorientation
as far as personality is concerned. The patient
always knows who and what he is. Complete mental
confusion is not the rule. Distractibility is usually very
well developed. Bonhöffer found an inability to supply
omitted words and syllables from well known phrases and
memory for test words and numbers was impaired. Articles
read are repeated with many changes and omissions.
Memory for remote events is usually well preserved.
Sometimes there is a falsification of the past.
The mood is anxious, fearful, seldom irritable, at times
actually humorous. Cheerfulness and fear of death occasionally
alternate.</p>

<p>The course of the disease is characterized by great
restlessness often with a tendency to talkativeness.
There is, however, no flight of ideas or rhyming. Delusions
of persecution occur in some cases. Anesthesias,
hyperesthesias, paresthesias, hypalgesias and sensitiveness
of nerves and muscles are noted. Romberg's sign
is present in some instances. Speech is often ataxic and
paraphasic, and in advanced eases entirely meaningless.
Tremors of the tongue and fingers are very characteristic.
Writing is very much affected as a result. Epileptiform
convulsions sometimes occur. Rarely focal symptoms,
facial paralysis and hemiplegia appear for a short
time. Reflexes are increased and ankle clonus occasionally
appears. Defective papillary reaction and unequal
pupils may be found, with diplopia and muscular
weakness. Sleep is seriously interfered with. Bodily
weight is reduced and blood pressure lowered. The temperature
is usually elevated and the pulse accelerated.
Albumen and sometimes sugar is present in the urine.
The delirium often stops as suddenly as it begins, terminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
in sleep, the patient being clear when he wakes.
The memory of events is not well retained on recovery.
The delirium may, however, become chronic and last for
months. Some cases terminate in a hallucinatory feeblemindedness.
This is likely to occur in psychopathic individuals.
Hallucinations of hearing are more common in
such conditions. People read their thoughts and influence
their minds. They are subjected to hypnotism and
electricity. The delusional ideas may be of a sexual
nature or grandiose in character. The mood may be
anxious or irritable. Suicidal tendencies sometimes appear.
Later a humorous trend is often noted. Tremors
and other neurological symptoms sometimes occur. Bonhöffer
found at autopsy a considerable fibre loss in the
central convolutions, the cerebellum and the column of
Goll. In the large pyramidal and motor cells of the anterior
central convolution the processes were deeply
stained. Some nuclear changes were noted and occasional
cells destroyed. Nissl described a granular degeneration
of the neurones with a prominence of the
"unstainable" substance, together with a swelling and
crumbling of the cell bodies. Alzheimer often found free
nuclei near the apical processes. In the glia cells and
vessel walls granular detritus was observed. Acute and
chronic cell alterations are more common in old alcoholics.
Pachymeningitis hemorrhagica is sometimes
found. Kraepelin considers it very doubtful whether
wine or beer drinking ever causes delirium tremens,
whisky and gin being the etiological factors as a general
rule.</p>

<p>Korsakow's psychosis was first described in 1887.
This is characterized by a loss of memory, and falsification,
with a marked tendency to disorientation, and is
often due to chronic alcoholism. It is practically always
accompanied by polyneuritic symptoms. According to
Bonhöffer, it usually follows delirium tremens. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
occurred in one-fourth of Kraepelin's cases. Occasionally
it begins suddenly, but as a rule gradually, during
the course of a chronic alcoholism. The patients frequently
complain of dizziness, headaches and fainting
spells. In the foreground of this affection is the impairment
of memory. This is one of the characteristic features.
The events of a few hours ago are completely forgotten.
Disorientation appears next. This affects time
more than anything else. The power of apprehension or
perception is very markedly impaired (one-sixth of the
normal in Kraepelin's cases) and the reaction time is
greatly increased. He also found memory reduced to
one-third or one-fourth of the normal on actual tests
(repetition of words and syllables). Falsification of past
events is also demonstrable. This often leads to elaborate
delusion formations. The mood is usually anxious
at first, later indifferent, dull, suspicious, irritable, in
some eases cheerful and even humorous. The methods
of life are completely changed. The patients neglect
themselves, lie in bed, etc. The physical signs are those
of neuritis. Muscular pains in the limbs appear, with
evidences of loss of power. Paraplegias and weakness
of the grip are found. Romberg's sign is frequently
present. Anesthesias, hyperesthesias or paresthesias
are noted. The reflexes are usually decreased, rarely increased.
Ataxia and other difficulties of gait are common.
The pulse is usually slower as a result of involvement
of the vagus. Speech difficulty, writing defects,
facial paralyses, weakness of the eye muscles, with inequality
and inactivity of the pupils, are to be expected.
There are usually tremors of the fingers. Epileptiform
convulsions are not infrequent. Aphasia, agraphia,
apraxia, monoplegia, hemiplegic, etc., are observed in
many cases. Physical disturbances of various kinds due
to chronic alcoholism are also present.</p>

<p>At autopsy acute and grave alterations are found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the cells of the second and third layers of the cortex.
A granular degeneration (Körnig Zellerkrankung) of the
cells is also referred to by Nissl. There is some fibre loss
in the central convolutions and the internal capsule, as
well as in the columns of Goll. Hemorrhages and thromboses
are to be found. Alzheimer found encephalitic
foci with proliferation of the cells of the vessel walls
sending out fibroblasts in the neighborhood, and a destruction
of the nerve fibres. These foci are found in the
central gray matter of the third ventricle, roof of the
aqueduct, etc. There is a formation of new vessels and
an outwandering of cells often accompanied by numerous
hemorrhages into the gray matter around the aqueduct
of Sylvius. Wernieke has described this process as an
"acute hemorrhagic polioencephalitis superior" and finds
it very commonly associated with Korsakow's psychosis.
It occurs, however, in other chronic alcoholic conditions.
The peripheral nerves also show a polyneuritis. Bonhöffer
found Korsakow's psychosis in three per cent of
his delirious cases. Thirty-three per cent of Kraepelin's
cases were women and only 24.5 per cent were under
forty years of age. Chotzen found Korsakow's psychosis
in three per cent of his male and in twenty-one per cent
of his female alcoholics.</p>

<p>The acute alcoholic hallucinoses as described by
Kraepelin are characterized by well defined delusions of
persecution and above all by hallucinations of hearing,
with a clear sensorium. In eighty per cent of the cases
the symptoms appear suddenly. Sometimes there is
first an abortive delirious attack. Usually a multiplicity
of hallucinations of hearing develop early. The patient
hears threats and abusive language, always directed
against himself. Visual hallucinations also occur, particularly
at night. The other sensory fields are often involved.
At the same time well marked delusions manifest
themselves. These suggest every possible variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
persecution. Ideas of grandeur are sometimes observed.
All of these symptoms are worse at night as a rule. Consciousness
is usually fairly clear, and there is no disorientation.
There is often a mixture of anxiety and
humor. Some cases, however, are irritable and suspicious.
Occasionally suicidal tendencies appear. Conduct
is usually not greatly disturbed and the patient
continues with his regular occupation. There is considerable
insomnia and a tendency to run around a great
deal and act foolishly at times. Physically, evidences
of chronic alcoholism are always to be found. The customary
duration of these acute conditions is from three
to eight weeks, although they sometimes last for months.
In a quarter of Kraepelin's cases the termination was in
deterioration. There is a strong tendency to recurrence.
The unrecovered cases are suspicious, surly, quarrelsome
and have hallucinations of hearing. This condition may
last for years. There are always occasional persecutory
ideas. One-fifth of Kraepelin's cases became chronic.
Bonhöffer described a paranoid type of long duration.
The hallucinoses appear usually earlier in life than Korsakow's
psychosis but later than delirium tremens. In
Kraepelin's experience delirium tremens is three times
as common as are hallucinoses. He looks upon these
two conditions, however, as different clinical manifestations
of "one and the same" disease process.</p>

<p>Alcoholic paralysis, so called, is a mixture of chronic
alcoholic symptoms with those of general paresis. There
is a mental deterioration with ideas of grandeur, emotional
dulness, hallucinations, delusions of jealousy,
speech defect, tremors and polyneuritis. Epileptiform
attacks are frequent. Most of these forms according to
Kraepelin belong to Korsakow's psychosis or polioencephalitis
hemorrhagica superior. Alcoholic conditions
may also be complicated by syphilis or arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p>Since the alcoholic psychoses have been generally recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
as such, there has been comparatively little
difference of opinion as to their differentiation. The
classification of the American Psychiatric Association is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The diagnosis of alcoholic psychosis should be restricted
to those mental disorders arising, with few exceptions,
in connection with <em>chronic</em> drinking and presenting
fairly well defined symptom-pictures. One must
guard against making the alcoholic group too inclusive.
Overindulgence in alcohol is often found to be merely
a symptom of another psychosis, or at any rate may be
incidental to another psychosis, such as general paralysis,
manic-depressive insanity, dementia praecox, epilepsy,
etc. The cases to be regarded as alcoholic psychoses
which do not result from chronic drinking are the episodic
attacks in some psychopathic personalities, the dipsomanias
(the true periodic drinkers) and pathological
intoxication, any of which may develop as the result of a
single imbibition or a relatively short spree.</p>

<p>"The following alcoholic reactions usually present
symptoms distinctive enough to allow of clinical differentiation:</p>

<p>"(a) Pathological intoxication: An unusual or abnormal
immediate reaction to taking a large or small
amount of alcohol. Essentially an acute mental disturbance
of short duration characterized usually by an excitement
or furor with confusion and hallucinations, followed
by amnesia.</p>

<p>"(b) Delirium tremens: An hallucinatory delirium
with marked general tremor and toxic symptoms.</p>

<p>"(c) Korsakow's psychosis: This occurs with or
without polyneuritis. The delirious type is not readily
differentiated in the early stages from severe delirium
tremens but is more protracted. The non-delirious type
presents a characteristic retention defect with disorientation,
fabrication, suggestibility and tendency to misidentify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
persons. Hallucinations are frequent after the
acute phase.</p>

<p>"(d) Acute hallucinosis: This is chiefly an auditory
hallucinosis of rapid development with clearness of the
sensorium, marked fears, and a more or less systematized
persecutory trend.</p>

<p>"(e) Chronic hallucinosis: This is an infrequent
type which may be regarded as the persistence of the
symptoms of the acute hallucinosis without change in the
character of the symptoms except perhaps a gradual lessening
of the emotional reaction accompanying the hallucinations.</p>

<p>"(f) Acute paranoid type: Suspicions, misinterpretations,
and persecutory ideas, often a jealous trend, hallucinations
usually subordinate; clearing up on withdrawal
of alcohol.</p>

<p>"(g) Chronic paranoid type: Persistence of symptoms
of the acute paranoid type with fixed delusions of
persecution or jealousy usually not influenced by withdrawal
of alcohol; difficult to differentiate from non-alcoholic
paranoid states or dementia praecox.</p>

<p>"(h) Alcoholic deterioration: A slowly developing
ethical, volitional and emotional change in the habitual
drinker; apparently relatively few cases are committed,
as the mental symptoms are not usually looked upon as
sufficient to justify the diagnosis of a definite psychosis.
The chief symptoms are ill humor and irascibility or a
jovial, careless, flippant, facetious mood; abusiveness to
family, unreliability and tendency to prevarication; in
some cases definite suspicions and jealousy; there is a
general lessening of efficiency and capacity for physical
and mental work; memory not seriously impaired. To
be excluded are residual defects due to Korsakow's psychosis,
or mental deterioration due to arteriosclerosis or
to traumatic lesions.</p>

<p>"(i) Other types, acute or chronic (to be specified)."

<p>Shadwell<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> states that in twenty-six Italian asylums
18.6 per cent of their cases were directly or indirectly the
result of alcoholism. Twenty-one and one-tenth per cent
of the males and 4.37 per cent of the females admitted to
the institutions of Switzerland from 1901 to 1904 were
alcoholics. Twenty-one and thirty-seven hundredths per
cent of the admissions to the hospitals in Denmark between
1899 and 1903 were suffering from alcoholic psychoses.
He gives the admission rate in Austria as fourteen
per cent and in France, 12.5 per cent. Clouston some
years ago estimated the admission rate in Great Britain
and Ireland to be about twenty per cent.</p>

<p>Pollock<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> has made a most interesting study of
1,739 cases of alcoholic psychoses, the total number admitted
to the New York state hospitals between October 1,
1909, and September 30, 1912. Seventy-six and five-tenths
per cent of these were men, and 23.5 per cent, women. The
different conditions represented were as follows: Pathological
intoxication, .7 per cent; alcoholic deterioration,
7.7 per cent; delirium tremens, 4.7 per cent; Korsakow's
psychosis, 18.8 per cent; acute hallucinosis, 36.7 per
cent; chronic hallucinosis, 2.2 per cent; paranoid states,
13.7 per cent; and all other forms, 15.5 per cent. Among
the males, acute hallucinosis predominated, while Korsakow's
psychosis constituted the largest percentage in
the female patients. Of the ascertained cases, .4 per cent
showed a defective make-up, 10.3 per cent were inferior
and 89.3 per cent were reported as normal. In seventy-four
per cent of the cases there was no history of insane
heredity. The father of the patient was insane in 3.7
per cent of the series and the mother in four per cent;
25.8 per cent in all had a history of insane heredity.
Thirty and five-tenths per cent of the male and thirty-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
per cent of the female patients had alcoholic fathers
and three per cent of the men and 8.8 per cent of the
women had alcoholic mothers. Pollock found the percentage
of intemperate fathers twice as high in the
alcoholic psychoses as in the patients suffering from
other conditions. In 94.1 per cent of the cases there was
no family history of nervous diseases. Eighty-one and
one-tenth per cent of the men and 93.4 per cent of the
women came from cities. Of the male patients 26.8 per
cent were unskilled laborers; 16.1 per cent of the women
were seamstresses, and 11.7 per cent, the wives of laborers.
The alcoholic cases constituted fifteen per cent
of the male, five per cent of the female, and ten per cent
of the total first rate admissions during the three years in
question. The rate of alcoholic psychoses was over twice in
as great in the foreign born population as in the native.</p>

<p>Three thousand four hundred and sixty-two cases
diagnosed as alcoholic psychoses were admitted to the
New York state hospitals during a period of eight years
(1912 to 1919 inclusive). Of these, pathological intoxication
constituted 2.91 per cent, delirium tremens, 5.97 per
cent, Korsakow's psychosis, 20.94 per cent, acute hallucinosis,
37.31 per cent, chronic hallucinosis, 3.66 per cent,
acute paranoid states, 5.01 per cent, chronic paranoid
states, 3.78 per cent, and alcoholic deterioration, 8.34 per
cent. The remainder represented miscellaneous types
variously described. These figures, of course, relate
largely to a time when there were no restrictions on the
sale of alcoholic beverages. During 1918 and 1919 the
admission rate for alcoholic psychoses in New York was
only 4.58 per cent. In Massachusetts in 1919 it was 7.47
per cent, and in twenty-one other hospitals in various
states it was 5.04 per cent. A study of 34,935 first admissions
to forty-eight hospitals in sixteen different
states during 1917, 1918 and 1919 showed the alcoholic
psychoses to represent 5.07 per cent of the total number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
With the advent of prohibition the alcoholic psychoses as
far as this country is concerned have become a matter of
little more than historical interest. The admission rate
in the New York state hospitals for 1920 was only 1.9 per
cent.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES DUE TO DRUGS AND OTHER
EXOGENOUS TOXINS</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Opium is a drug which has been in quite common use
for many centuries. According to E. M. Holmes of London,
it was known to Theophrastus nearly three hundred
years before the Christian era and two different forms
were described by Dioscorides in the neighborhood of
77 A.D. Nicander (185 to 135 B.C.) discussed at some
length the effects of a "drink prepared from the tears
which exude from poppy heads." Pliny in the first century
A.D. recorded several cases of suicide by means of
opium, which he spoke of as not being a rare occurrence.
The drug is said to have been introduced into China by
the Arabs in the thirteenth century. An edict prohibiting
opium smoking was issued by the emperor Yung
Cheng in 1729. It was not until 1909 that the British government
agreed to completely prohibit the importation
of morphine into China. The sale and use of narcotics
has, however, been regulated in India for many years.
Morphine, the first alkaloid ever discovered, was isolated
and named by Sertürner, a German apothecary, in 1805.
Over twenty derivatives of opium have been reported
since that time. The real history of morphinomania, according
to Erlenmeyer, began in 1864. As far as can be
determined, opium was not grown in America until 1865.
In 1906 it was estimated that over thirteen millions of
people were addicted to opium smoking in China alone.</p>

<p>The literature of medicine contains numerous references
to the mental disturbances due to opium and morphine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Krafft-Ebing<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> says of the habitual user that
"Intelligence, it is true, is practically spared, but the
highest mental functions&mdash;character, ethic feeling, self-control,
mental energy, and force&mdash;always suffer.... In
severe cases we find, in addition, weakness of memory,
especially defect in the power of exact reproduction, difficulty
of intellectual activity that may reach the degree
of torpor, occasionally psychic depression reaching even
marked dysthymia and taedium vitae, great emotionality,
and, in general, profound deficiency of resistive power to
affects; and besides, there may be episodically nervous
restlessness, excitement, even attacks of fear due to vasomotor
causes, and occasionally visual hallucinations."
He also describes hallucinatory delirious conditions due
to abstinence which strongly suggest alcoholism. In addition
to clouded states of the same kind, Paton<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> speaks
of the early occurrence, in chronic cases, of marked
symptoms of hysteria. Apprehension and anxiety develop
with mild suspicions and a moral deterioration
very similar to that induced by alcohol. There may be
considerable irritability and egotism, with a suggestion
of flight of ideas and motor restlessness. Hallucinations
and delusions are sometimes present, particularly if alcoholism
is a complicating factor. Hyperesthesias, paresthesias
and anesthesias are common. Barker<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> also
speaks of a degeneration of character evidenced by
ethical defects, lying, egotism and loss of memory. Under
abstinence symptoms he includes restlessness, anxiety,
despair, vomiting and delirium. White<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> regards the
neuropathic diathesis as the most important cause of the
morphine or opium habit. In habitual users he has noted
hallucinated states with a paranoid coloring or a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
delirium. He has also observed delusions of persecution
and poisoning, but emphasizes the importance of the
gradual mental deterioration.</p>

<p>One of the most elaborate studies ever made of morphinism
was that of Erlenmeyer,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> whose work on this
subject reached nearly five hundred pages in its third
edition. The mental disturbances associated with intoxication
he divides into two groups&mdash;transitory and
permanent. The former includes anxious states, hallucinations
of vision and stuporous attacks; the latter, the
intellectual and emotional deteriorations already described.
There is a definite character change strongly
suggesting "moral insanity," an artificial "senium praecox"
being induced. He also refers to distinct psychoses
resulting from chronic morphinism, the most common
one being of the paranoid variety. Abstinence symptoms
of sudden development include collapse and delirium.
Restless anxiety and insomnia may usher in a mild delirious
condition. Of these he described two forms,&mdash;one,
a quiet, partially clouded dream state and another,
with excitement, elation and hallucinations. The first
form is the more common. The second is usually of short
duration but may last for several weeks or even months,
often manifesting paranoid ideas.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> calls attention to the important fact
that morphine stimulates mental activities as well as
inhibiting psychomotor processes, and is not therefore a
logical drug for the production of sleep. The habitué
feels himself capable of much greater exertions but is
handicapped by an inhibition of will power. This psychological
mechanism determines the difference between
the intoxication of morphine and that of alcohol. Nissl
found the cortical cells of dogs poisoned with morphine
decreased in size but not destroyed. The stainable substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
was rarefied and weakly stained, the achromatic
substance, on the other hand, being unusually prominent.
In chronic morphinism Kraepelin found memory uncertain,
mental capacity diminished and fatigability increased.
There are alternating periods of comparatively
good health and dull somnolence with exhaustion or nervous
restlessness. The mood is variable,&mdash;depressed, discouraged,
hypochondriacal, irritable, or even confident
and overbearing. Anxious states occasionally occur at
night and suicidal attempts may be made. Character
changes are also described by Kraepelin. The patients
become complaining, oversensitive to pain and to opposition,
are indolent, irresolute, irresponsible and neglect
their work. Their interest is more and more confined
to the drug. Their untruthfulness and deceitfulness are
well known. Sleep is much disturbed, often by visual
hallucinations. Phantastic delusional ideas are also
manifested. Paresthesias and hyperesthesias are common.
The reflexes are active and usually increased. The
gait is unsteady or even ataxic. Speech disturbances,
paralysis of the muscles of the eye, diplopia and loss of
accommodation have been noted. A typical Korsakow's
complex was observed by Heymann. Appetite is lost,
bodily weakness and loss of weight appear and sugar
is often present in the urine. Perspiration, dizzy spells,
confusion and stupor may be caused by circulatory disturbances.
Sexual power is diminished, and menstrual
disturbances are frequent. These symptoms may appear
early or may not develop for years, depending on the individual
case. Kraepelin also describes forms similar
to dipsomania in alcoholics. He attributes these to epileptic
or hysterical constitutions. Many of his cases
were decidedly psychopathic with tendencies to abuse
the use of alcohol, tobacco and coffee. Of thirty-eight
patients observed by him, nineteen used only one drug,
ten of them were addicted to two, eight others to three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and one patient to as many as five. Under abstinence
symptoms he includes exhaustion, restlessness, yawning,
sneezing, anxiety, chilliness, oppression, sense deceptions
and pains in various parts of the body. The patient is
sleepless and sometimes goes into an excitement with
suicidal inclinations. In some cases a condition develops
which markedly resembles delirium tremens. In others,
hallucinatory symptoms are more marked. These manifestations
may last for several days or for a few weeks.
Hysterical dream states with hallucinations and convulsive
seizures may also occur.</p>

<p>Cocaine was first isolated by Gardeka in 1855, but was
given the name it now bears by Niemann. It did not come
into extensive use until many years later and was not
employed generally in ophthalmological practice until
about 1884. Freud in 1885 called attention to the fact
that small doses of cocaine produced a stimulation of the
mental activities with euphoria and an increased capacity
for both mental and physical work. Mannheim,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> who
reviewed ninety-nine cases of cocaine poisoning in 1891,
found that the first symptoms were drowsiness and deep
sleep, occasionally followed by coma and collapse. He
observed that some patients became restless and excited,
dizzy, laughing and crying alternately, while others were
very talkative and uneasy, walking up and down with a
drunken gait. Usually he found a complete amnesia
afterwards.</p>

<p>The first study of psychoses due to cocaine was made
by Erlenmeyer<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> in 1886. As he afterwards modestly
observed, "This first report on cocomania, which was
founded on thirteen cases, completely exhausted the subject,
and nothing essential has been added to the symptomatology
then published." He found that it was almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
always combined with the morphine habit. This
was probably due to the fact that cocaine, at one time,
was used extensively in the treatment of morphinism.
Although the assimilation of food is not affected and gastritis
was not a symptom, Erlenmeyer usually found a
great decrease in bodily weight, as much as twenty to
thirty per cent in some cases within a few weeks. Sleep
is much disturbed and insomnia the rule. The most common
form of mental disturbance he found to consist of
attacks of violent excitement accompanied by delusions
of persecution. Dangerous, impulsive assaults may
occur. Very often, however, there were transitory confusional
states with hallucinations of hearing and vision,
succeeded by a mental deterioration and loss of memory.
Visual hallucinations usually appear early. A common
and peculiar symptom is the appearance of dark spots
and points on a white background, attributed by Erlenmeyer
to multiple scotomata. Auditory hallucinations he
also found to be frequent. Sensory deceptions give rise
to peculiar ideas such as the presence of the "cocaine
bug" which the patient often tries to catch. Volubility
is another characteristic feature of the disease which
he refers to. As abstinence symptoms he describes forms
of depression, with weakness of will power. Barker
refers to psychoses of an acute hallucinatory confusional
type as a result of cocainism.</p>

<p>Krafft-Ebing speaks of episodic toxic deliria with
visual and auditory hallucinations resembling those of
alcohol and accompanied by delusions of persecution or
jealousy with visions of multitudes of small animals, etc.
He has not observed delirious conditions due to abstinence.</p>

<p>In acute cocainism Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> finds an increased
pulse rate, a lowering of blood pressure and the appearance
of an excitement of the intoxication type with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
agreeable sensation of warmth and well-being. There
is an initial motor excitement followed eventually by
weakness. This is a somewhat similar reaction to that
caused by alcohol, but it is more marked. Small doses
cause the habitué to feel elated, talkative and inclined
to prolific writings. He feels a greatly increased efficiency
but does not show a corresponding productivity.
Larger doses cause delirious excitement with a tendency
to sudden collapse. After a prolonged use of the drug
a condition of nervous excitement ensues, with an increasing
susceptibility to intoxication, a mild flight of
ideas, a diminished capacity for mental exertion, loss of
will power and failure of memory. The patient is busy
with entirely useless activities, quite voluble, and writes
incessantly. He becomes unreliable, forgetful, disorderly
and careless in his conduct. The mood alternates between
one of well-being, irritability, suspicious anxiety and emotional
dulness. Kraepelin speaks of the great loss of
weight, increased reflexes, dilated pupils, rapid pulse,
etc. Insomnia is a common symptom. The characteristic
psychosis of cocaine, however, in his opinion is a paranoid
condition somewhat resembling the alcoholic forms.
The onset is usually sudden, with irritability, suspicion
and anxious restlessness, together with the sudden development
of hallucinations of various kinds. Auditory
hallucinations are particularly numerous and are very
active. The patient's surroundings appear strange and
unreal. He sees all kinds of pictures of the most realistic
type. Tactile hallucinations are very common. The patient
often shoots at his imaginary persecutors or attempts
suicide to escape them. A typical symptom is
the appearance of delusions of jealousy. With all of
this the patient is usually well oriented. Only occasionally
is there a clouding of consciousness and confusion.
Insight is, however, always lacking. Even with a clear
sensorium the delusional ideas are firmly retained. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
mood is excited, irritable, sometimes angry and exasperated,
but most frequently depressed and suspicious. The
conduct is characterized by restlessness and uncertainty.
There is usually a marked volubility suggesting a conscious
delirium at times. The whole development of these
conditions is rapid, often within a few weeks. They disappear
as quickly in many instances.</p>

<p>Chronic cocainism is very similar to the alcoholic conditions.
From a symptomatic point of view, however, the
paranoid cocaine psychoses occupy relatively an intermediate
position between alcoholic delirium and the paranoid
states.</p>

<p>In experiments on dogs Nissl found a stainability of
the achromatic substance in the neurones, a beginning
shrinkage of the cell nuclei and a slight increase of leucocytes
in the pia and vessels.</p>

<p>Chloral-hydrate, which has been employed medicinally
since 1869, is much less frequently a cause of mental
disturbance than morphine or cocaine. Krafft-Ebing
describes its use combined usually with other drugs as
causing moroseness, depression and mental dulness. He
speaks, too, of a delirium due to sudden withdrawal.
This condition, he says, may also be caused by paraldehyde.
The craving for chloral, on the part of those who
have acquired the habit, is much less intense than that
for morphine or cocaine. Other drugs are very readily
substituted for that reason. A prolonged use leads to
digestive disturbances, constipation alternating with
diarrhea, jaundice, flushing of the face, congestion of
the conjunctiva, fulness of the head, palpitations, weak
pulse, dyspnea and general malnutrition with erythematous,
urticareous or pustular skin eruptions, etc. Hyperesthesias,
anesthesias, paresthesias, pains in the
limbs, sensations of heat and cold, tremors, occasional
loss of muscular power and sometimes ataxia appear.
The reflexes are usually decreased. Epileptiform convulsions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
have been observed although they are infrequent.
The mental disturbances of chloral have been
studied by Wilson.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He describes the habitué as "dull,
apathetic, somnolent, disposed to neglect his ordinary
duties and affairs. He passes much of his time in a state
of dreamy lethargy or in deep and prolonged sleep, from
which he awakes unrefreshed and in pain." Headache is
an almost constant symptom. It is associated with "confusion
of thought, inability to converse intelligently or to
articulate distinctly, and other evidences of cerebral congestion."
Vertigo is also common. The mental state is
characterized by dulness, apathy and confusion, alternating
with periods of irritability and restlessness. The
depression is not so marked as in morphinism. Inability
to concentrate the mind, loss of memory, and intellectual
enfeeblement are terminal conditions. Occasionally in
the worst cases hallucinations, delusions, clouding and
states of excitement are observed. Abstinence symptoms
are headache, insomnia, neuralgia, pains in the limbs,
nervousness, restlessness and formication. A delirium
similar to that of alcoholism has been referred to by
various writers.</p>

<p>Casamajor<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> has described two types of mental
disturbance due to the use of bromides,&mdash;a condition of
apathy with dulness and an active delirium. The first is
characterized by apathy, dulness, somnolence, weakness
and failing memory, and is often observed in epileptics
who have been subjected to protracted periods of bromide
treatment. He has also reported toxic deliria showing
marked hallucinations with psychomotor unrest, fabrications
and paraphasia. This may be associated with unequal,
sluggish pupils, increased or unequal patellar reflexes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
tremors, ankle clonus and an unsteady gait&mdash;a
general condition suggesting paresis. Hoch<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> also reported
cases showing hallucinations, clouding, disorientation,
amnesia, fabrications and aphasic disturbances, together
with physical signs simulating general paresis.
O'Malley and Franz<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> described somewhat similar
symptoms in a case showing dilated sluggish pupils, exaggerated
knee-jerks, ankle clonus, tremors and unsteady
gait, etc. The mental disturbance was characterized by
a confused dreamlike state, with hallucinations, memory
defect, a disturbance of attention, and a marked tendency
to fabrication. The fabrication in their opinion suggested
a delirious origin rather than the Korsakow complex.</p>

<p>The first references to the psychoses caused by lead
intoxication were apparently those of Dehäne in 1771.
Tanquerel des Planches published his "Encephalopathia
Saturnina" in 1836. He recognized three forms of this
condition,&mdash;the delirious, the comatose and the convulsive.
Edsall<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> describes as encephalopathies all of
the cerebral symptoms due to chronic lead poisoning.
In addition to transitory hemiplegias, aphasia and
choreiform movements, he refers to the occurrence of
hysterical manifestations, such as hemianesthesias associated
with outbursts of excitement. Coma and clouded
states often occur. These may be accompanied by convulsions.
In the delirious form there may be a marked excitement
with psychomotor activity. Hallucinations are
common, particularly in alcoholic cases. Delusions of persecution
are not infrequent. There is usually a rise of
temperature throughout the attack. The delirium may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
last from a few days to several weeks. Symptom complexes
strongly suggesting general paresis have been reported.
Krafft-Ebing speaks of psychoses characterized
by mental depression, feelings of oppression, irritability,
mild delusions of persecution and terrifying hallucinations.
Epileptiform attacks, paralyses and tremors are
also mentioned. He refers to deliria which may arise
spontaneously or follow an initial stupor, and speaks of
the chronic lead psychoses as toxic hallucinatory confusional
conditions. Six cases of this nature were reported
by Bartens in 1887. Oppenheim has occasionally found
hysterical symptoms associated with chronic lead poisoning.
Rayner<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> found mental disturbances preceded by
such premonitory symptoms as headache, restlessness,
disturbed sleep, terrifying dreams, tinnitus aurium,
flashes of light, difficulty of thought, and depression.
This terminated in a few days in a delirium characterized
by anxiety and visual hallucinations. Other cases showed
a more marked depression and stupor, sometimes alternating
with delirium and violent excitement, accompanied
by hallucinations and speech defects. Amaurosis and convulsions
are spoken of frequently as common symptoms.
Conditions similar to general paresis have been noted
by various observers.</p>

<p>There have been very few contributions to medical
literature on the subject of psychoses caused by arsenic.
In discussing forms of poisoning due to that drug Edsall
expressed the opinion that "marked psychic symptoms
are unusual." Casamajor makes the statement that
"in very severe cases memory disturbances have been
noted, and in some the typical Korsakow polyneuritic
psychosis." According to Oppenheim a rise of temperature
associated with a delirium may be observed at the
onset of arsenical poisoning and may also occur later in
the disease. Psychoses due to arsenic were not referred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to by Krafft-Ebing, Arndt, Schüle, Ziehen or Kraepelin.</p>

<p>Edsall<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> mentions as the symptoms of chronic mercurial
poisoning, headache, restlessness, mental depression
and weakness. Most striking features are tremors
and a peculiar emotional disturbance referred to as "erythism."
Tremors of the lips and facial muscles are
common and speech disturbance and choreiform movements
have been noted. Symptoms suggesting neurasthenia
and hysteria have also been reported. Naunyn
has described excitements due to mercury characterized
by anxiety and fears with hallucinations and sleeplessness.
He also speaks of manic attacks, depressions and
mental deterioration as associated conditions.</p>

<p>Argyria or chronic silver poisoning is said to be accompanied
often by a marked sensitiveness and occasional
episodes of actual depression due to the discoloration
and pigmentation of the face.</p>

<p>Psychoses due to various gases are occasionally encountered.
Illuminating gas is a rather common means
of suicide, as is shown by the newspapers. It has been
found that the cause of death in these cases is carbon
monoxide, which is also often reported as responsible for
the asphyxiation of workmen in garages and other places
where gasoline motors are used. This occasionally results
from the improper ventilation of laundries, engine
rooms, gas plants, iron foundries, etc. These conditions
have been very fully studied by O'Malley.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The
mental disorders due to carbon monoxide are described as
being characterized by a sudden attack of confusion and
clouding associated with a period of complete amnesia.
There may be disturbances of attention and Korsakow's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
psychosis is sometimes strongly suggested, with memory
impairment and tendencies towards fabrication. This
condition may be transitory or last for many months.
On recovery the patient usually has no recollection of any
events taking place after the time of the poisoning. Immediately
following the initial unconsciousness there may
be excited periods or delirious states with aphasic disturbances.
In chronic cases delusions of persecution are
often observed. The psychosis frequently does not develop
until several weeks or months after the actual poisoning.
Several observers have referred to a mask-like
expression of the face, with emotional indifference,
apathy and outbursts of laughter. The mood has been
described as characterized by emotional instability.
O'Malley calls attention to the important fact that the
mental disturbance may have been the cause of suicidal
attempts rather than a result of the gas poisoning. Confused
delirious states due to carbon monoxide poisoning,
also conditions resembling Korsakow's disease, have been
described by Kraepelin. Several cases somewhat similar
to that described by O'Malley have been observed at the
Boston State Hospital.</p>

<p>An analysis of the statistics of American institutions
shows that psychoses due to drugs and other exogenous
poisons are quite rare in this country. They represented
only .39 per cent of the admissions to the New York state
hospitals during a period of eight years. The number
admitted to Massachusetts hospitals is still less. In a
total of 70,987 first admissions to forty-eight hospitals in
sixteen different states there were only 324 cases due to
exogenous poisons. This constituted .65 per cent of the
total number admitted. It is interesting to note that during
a period of eight years, when 49,640 cases were admitted
to the New York state hospitals, 154 cases of psychosis
due to opium or morphine were reported, five due
to metallic poisons, eighteen caused by gases, and nine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of types unspecified. No case of uncomplicated cocainism
was reported during that period of time.</p>

<p>The 314 drug habitués in the state hospitals of the
entire country as shown by the census of January 1, 1920,
and reported by the National Committee for Mental Hygiene,
represented .15 per cent of the mental cases under
treatment in those institutions on the same date. The
808 drug addicts shown by the same census in all of the
institutions of the United States, both public and private,
represented .34 per cent of the mental cases reported by
them. The fact that the private hospitals showed 4.5
per cent of drug cases in the same census is significant.
It indicates that these cases are largely cared for in
institutions of that type, and furthermore, that their number
is very small.</p>

<p>The result of the investigations made in 1919 by a
committee appointed by the Secretary of the United
States Treasury is of great interest in view of the number
of drug psychoses treated in our state hospitals. The
committee's report<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> shows an estimated annual per
capita use of opium in Italy of 1.25 grains; Germany, two
grains; France, three; Holland, 3.5; and the United
States, thirty-three grains. More opium is consumed
here than in any other country in the world. The committee
was of the opinion that ninety per cent of it was
used for other than medicinal purposes. The estimated
number of habitués in New York City at that time as
reported by the City Commissioner of Health was 103,000.
The questionnaire sent out by the committee to
physicians registered under the Harrison Act showed that
the number of cases under treatment for morphinism in
various parts of the country was as follows:&mdash;California,
3,338; Connecticut, 11,740; Illinois, 8,218; Indiana,
8,438; Massachusetts, 14,770; New Jersey, 5,900; New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
York, 37,095; Pennsylvania, 10,202, etc. The estimated
number of drug users in the United States was given at
one million, and the amount of money expended by them
annually was said to approximate sixty-one million dollars.
In view of these statements the number of psychoses
reported in the hospitals is astonishing.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH PELLAGRA</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The origin of pellagra is shrouded in mystery. Although
first described by Casal, the name now attached to
the disease was suggested by Frappoli in 1771. He
referred to it as of ancient origin at that time and probably
identical with the "pellarella" reported in Milan in
1578. Niles<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> is of the opinion that the peculiar malady
existing among the American Indians and mentioned by
Baruino in 1600 was almost certainly pellagra. It is
interesting to note that he attributed it to the use of
corn. The disease was observed in Spain by Gaspar
Casal in 1735 and appeared in Italy about twenty-five
years later. Of the 4,404 admissions to the St. Clement's
Hospital at Venice between 1873 and 1880 over thirty
per cent showed symptoms of pellagra. In 1912, according
to Niles, the number of cases in Italy was estimated
at approximately one hundred thousand. The disease
was apparently first reported in France in 1818. It has
been common in Egypt since 1892 at least and is said
to have occurred there as early as 1847. Cases were reported
in this country by John P. Gray at the Utica
State Hospital and by Tyler at the McLean Hospital, in
Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1863. It is now thought
to have been very common in the Andersonville and
Libby prisons during the civil war, although not diagnosed
as such at the time.</p>

<p>Few cases were reported in this country prior to
1907, when it was found to be present at the Columbia,
South Carolina, State Hospital by Babcock. Pellagra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
constituted seven per cent of the admissions to that institution
in 1908, fifteen per cent in 1909, twenty in 1910,
over twenty-seven in 1911 and twenty-six per cent in
1915. Sixty-one per cent of the deaths in the hospital
during the latter year were due to that disease. The
health officer of the state reported four hundred cases
in South Carolina in 1909 and six thousand in 1914.
Babcock is now of the opinion that pellagra undoubtedly
existed for twenty years or more at Columbia before its
significance was known. In 1910 the disease was found
to be present in thirty different states and represented
about three thousand cases.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Of these the largest
numbers were in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas,
and Illinois. The importance of this question had already
been recognized and a national conference was
held on the subject at Columbia in 1909. During the
same year the governor of Illinois appointed a commission
to make a thorough study of pellagra in that state.
The disease has been made the subject of elaborate investigation
and study by the United States Public
Health Service and several publications have been issued
by that department.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extended discussion and scientific
research of the last few years, the question as to
the definite etiology of pellagra has not as yet been positively
settled. The maize or Indian corn theory was first
advocated by Mazari in 1810. He believed the symptoms
to be due to a deficiency in gluten. Sette in 1826 attributed
the disease to a fungus (scimelpige) growing on
corn and producing a poison from the oil in the grain.
The smut of corn, "Ustilago Maydis," was suggested as
a possible factor by Pari in 1860. In 1872 Lombroso
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
formulated his toxic theory: "In pellagra we are dealing
with an intoxication produced by poisons developed
in spoiled corn through the action of certain microorganisms,
in themselves harmless to man." He also announced
the discovery of "pellagrosein," a toxic substance
extracted from spoiled corn. In 1902 Ceni advanced
the theory that the disease was caused by the
action of certain moulds such as the aspergillus fumigatus
and flavescens. The Illinois Pellagra Commission in
1911 came to the conclusion after an elaborate investigation
of the subject that the primary etiological factor
involved was a living microorganism of unknown nature,
that the probable source of infection was through the
intestinal tract and that a deficient amount of animal
protein in the diet probably acted as a predisposing cause.
Funk in 1914 suggested a vitamin deficiency in the diet
brought about by the consumption of overmilled corn.
Voegtlin<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> in the same year expressed the opinion that
the disease was essentially a chronic intoxication,&mdash;"While
the agents at work in this intoxication are as yet
unknown, I am inclined to believe that toxic substances
exist in certain vegetable foods, not necessarily spoiled,
which, if consumed by man over a long period of time,
may produce an injurious effect on certain organs of
the body.... It is probably more than a mere coincidence
that the population of that part of the world in
which pellagra is endemic lives on a mainly vegetable
diet."</p>

<p>In 1916 a study was made by Koch and Voegtlin<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
of the chemical changes found in the nervous system in
pellagra which was very significant in its results. They
found an increase in water with a decrease in proteins and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
lipoids, the latter reaction being attributed to a degeneration
in the white matter. There was also a relative increase
in the cholesterol content, looked upon as a compensatory
protective function tending to replace the
loss in lipoids. The most marked chemical alterations
were found in the cord. On feeding monkeys and rats
with an exclusive vegetable diet, changes in the chemical
reaction of the brain and cord of almost exactly the same
type were brought about experimentally.</p>

<p>Goldberger<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> in 1916 made an interesting report of
a series of investigations carried on by the United States
Public Health Service at Jackson, Mississippi. A large
number of cases of pellagra were treated by largely supplementing
the dietary with fresh meats, milk and leguminous
vegetables. The carbohydrate content was reduced
at the same time but corn was not entirely discontinued.
Of 209 cases studied, 172 remained under continuous observation
with a recurrence of symptoms in only one
case. In a similar experiment made at the Georgia
State Sanitarium seventy-two patients, all of whom had
shown attacks previously, were treated for a year without
symptoms. A number of volunteers at the Mississippi
State Penitentiary were given a test diet consisting
of wheat flour, corn meal, grits, cornstarch, white polished
rice, granulated sugar, cane syrup, sweet potatoes,
pork fat, cabbage, collards, turnip greens and coffee. Of
the eleven convicts receiving this diet, six developed a
typical dermatitis with slight nervous and gastrointestinal
symptoms. The results of these investigations
were not offered by the United States Public Health
Service as being conclusive and incontrovertible evidence
as to the etiology of pellagra, which must still be looked
upon as being somewhat in doubt. The dietetic factors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
concerned in the production of the disease have been
under serious consideration for a century or more.</p>

<p class="p2b">This information was supplemented by a study of pellagra
in the general population of the cotton mill communities
in South Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In comparing the dietaries
of pellagrous households with those of the families
escaping infection it was found that the former consumed
less meat, milk, butter, cheese and eggs. The
value of their diet in calories and proteins was lower.
The proteins contributed, moreover, were more largely
from cereals, peas, beans, etc. The carbohydrate content
was also lower. They concluded that the particular
points involved <span class="no-break">were:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p1c">"1. A physiologically defective protein supply,</p>

<p class="p1c">"2. A low or inadequate supply of fat-soluble vitamin,</p>

<p class="p1c">"3. A low or inadequate supply of water-soluble
vitamin, and</p>

<p>"4. A defective mineral supply."</p>

<p class="p2">They were also of the opinion that the disease could be
prevented by "including in the diet an adequate supply
of animal protein foods (particularly milk, including butter,
and lean meat)."</p>

<p>Roberts<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> in 1920 made a study of twenty-five cases
of pellagra encountered in private practice. In every
instance the disease developed in families provided with
an abundance of food of all kinds. An analysis of the
actual consumption, however, showed that "not one of
the patients ate a well rounded, balanced diet of meat,
milk, eggs or wholesome vegetables." Either they were
suffering from a lack of nourishment in every case or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
they were eating practically the same diet that Goldberger
used experimentally in producing pellagra.</p>

<p>As defined by Barker<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> pellagra "is a disease characterized
by peculiar cutaneous, digestive, nervous and
mental disturbances, usually running a chronic course,
with periodic exacerbation, but sometimes developing
acutely and proceeding quickly to a fatal termination."
He speaks of the disease as developing during the winter
months usually with neurasthenic manifestations&mdash;fatigability,
insomnia, slight vertigo, and feelings of apprehension,
followed by digestive disturbances later in
the spring. The parts of the skin surface exposed to the
sun develop an erythema followed by a dermatitis. Nervous
and mental symptoms may appear later. In some
cases the disease tends to recur every spring. The skin
lesions have been described as a characteristic "mask"
shown on the face, the pellagrous collar, a bandlike eruption
on the neck, Casal's "necklace" extending downwards
over the sternum, the pellagrous "butterfly,"
"gauntlets," etc. The more common digestive disorders
are stomatitis and glossitis, gastric disturbances and
diarrhea. Neurological symptoms observed include
hyperesthesia, paresthesia, anesthesia, tremors, paralyses,
muscular pains, increased reflexes and occasional
convulsions.</p>

<p>The literature of pellagra and its associated mental
disturbances has been elaborately reviewed by Babcock.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
The following references appear in a comprehensive
study of this subject made by him in 1910. Griesinger<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
described the pellagrous psychoses as characterized
by a vague, incoherent delirium, accompanied
by loquacity and loss of memory without any violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
excitement or special disorder of the intelligence. The
depression gradually develops into a torpor of all the
mental powers together with muscular weakness, a condition
resembling general paresis. Mongeri<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> states
that the psychoses usually begin with a period of depression
accompanied by hypochondriacal ideas. This is followed
by confusion and hallucinations of hearing.
Delusions of persecution appear, with a marked tendency
to suicide by drowning. Crimes of various kinds may be
caused by the paranoid condition which usually terminates
in deterioration. In speaking of chronic and acute
forms Bianchi<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> says: "The former is characterized
by general depression, melancholia, confusion, slow dementia,
paresthesias and ataxic gait. Contractures and
subsulti are absent, although in most instances the reflexes
are exaggerated. In the acute form we have rapid
elevation of temperature, 39° to 41° C.; intense neuro-muscular
excitement, subsulti, contractures, muscular
rigidity, exaggerated reflexes and confusion with phases
of exaltation. There are numerous intermediate forms
in which we observe a great variety of psychical phenomena,
and also alternations of excitement and depression.
Phases of remission and of apparent recovery are
observed, especially at certain seasons." Régis<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> is
quoted as follows: "It is recognized that the most common
form of psychosis in pellagra is mental confusion
with melancholy or dreamy delirium. This occurs more
or less markedly in most of the cases. It is manifested
by inertia, a passivity, an indifference, a considerable
torpor; by insomnia, hallucinations often terrifying,
both of sight and hearing; by delirious conceptions with
fixed ideas of hopelessness, of damnation, of fear, anxiety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
persecution, poisoning; of possession by devils and
witches, of refusal of food, and so marked a tendency to
suicide, and to suicide by drowning, that Strombio gave
it the name hydromania. This melancholy depression,
which can reach, in certain cases, even to stupor, is always
based upon a foundation of obtusion, of intellectual hebetude,
and of considerable general debility, which becomes
permanent and terminates by degrees in dementia,
in proportion as the pellagrous cachexia makes new progress.
It is accompanied sometimes by a polyneuritis.
The mental confusion of pellagrins can, in place of changing
directly into dementia, turn to a chronic mental confusion.
One may observe in pellagra, as in every grave
intoxication, a morbid state resembling general paresis
(pellagrous pseudo-general paresis). This occurs especially
in the cases where instead of habitual melancholy
ideas, the patients present ideas of satisfaction and of
wealth." Procopiu<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> found his patients "sad, apathetic,
silent; in the more advanced stage they are melancholy,
and fall sometimes into an absolute mutism, or
respond with difficulty, and have the air of not understanding
what is said to them. Sometimes this melancholy
is accompanied with stupor, and leads the poor
pellagrins into dementia." He also speaks of the occurrence
of sudden outbursts of manic excitement.
Tanzi<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> refers to the existence of both pellagrous mania
and melancholia but speaks of a characteristic amentia
"which manifests itself acutely in loss of time and
place, loss of memory, confusion, hallucinations, and
paresthesias, from which there arise morbid impulses
and delusions. Pellagrous amentia, often assumes a depressive
form, which simulates melancholia, and in some
cases either from time to time, or throughout the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
course of the psychosis, it is accompanied by exaltation,
which gives it some resemblance to mania."</p>

<p>Gregor<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> in 1907 made a careful analysis of seventy-two
cases. He classified these in seven groups:
1. Neurasthenia; 2. Acute stuporous dementia; 3. Amentia
(acute confusional insanity); 4. Acute delirium; 5.
Katatonia; 6. Anxiety psychoses; and 7. Manic-depressive
insanity. The neurasthenic cases (9.72 per cent)
exhibited headache, pain in the gastric region, vertigo,
paresthesia and lassitude, with a sense of unrest and
anxiety as well as ill-defined apprehensions. There was
a sense of mental incapacity and feeling of illness, together
with a mild depression and hypochondriacal tendencies.
The cases diagnosed as acute dementia (13.88
per cent) were of the same general type but with more
advanced symptoms. These showed a decided stupor,
tending to remission, deep mental depression, a sense of
insufficiency and "peculiar subjective troubles." The
tendency to suicide was prominent and caused this group
to be called melancholia by some. Many cases showed
the gradual development of an affectless stupor. Catatonic
symptoms and stereotypies occasionally occurred.
Memory disturbances were well marked in this form.
The psychoses disappeared invariably with the symptoms
of the pellagra. The Amentia group (44.44 per
cent) included long-continued cases with remission and
intermissions. Terrifying hallucinations and violent
motor excitement appeared frequently, followed by a
stupor which was sometimes interrupted by delirium.
Hallucinations were usually present and some had dream
states. These cases often terminate unfavorably. Acute
delirium constituted 2.7 per cent of the seventy-two cases,
and katatonia occurred in 13.8 per cent. These cases
passed rapidly into dementia. Anxiety psychoses (4.16
per cent) were diagnosed in a few instances, but were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
complicated by occasional stupors. Two and seven-tenths
per cent of the cases were classified as manic-depressive
insanity. Mobley, according to Babcock,
found the following types represented at the Georgia
State Sanitarium:&mdash;1. Acute intoxication psychosis, with
psychomotor suspension; 2. Infective exhaustive psychosis,
with psychomotor retardation or excitation; 3.
Symptomatic melancholia with psychomotor retardation;
and 4. Manic-depressive psychoses.</p>

<p>Singer<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> in 1915 suggested the following classification
of the psychoses associated with <span class="no-break">pellagra:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p7">1. Disorders directly due to the pellagra toxin:</p>
   <p class="p8">(a) Symptomatic depression; (b) Delirious pictures.</p>

<p class="p7">2. Disorders based on peculiarities in personal make-up,
the attack of "insanity" being precipitated
by pellagra;</p>
   <p class="p8">(a) Manic-depressive disorders; (b) Hysteria; (c)
Psychasthenia; (d) Dementia praecox; (e) Paranoic
developments; and</p>

<p class="p7">3. Disorders due to definite brain changes with pellagra
merely as a complication:</p>
   <p class="p8">(a) Arteriosclerotic dementia; (b) Senile dementia;
(c) Presenile psychoses; (d) General paralysis
of the insane.</p>

<p class="p10a">He found mental disturbances of some kind in about
forty per cent of the cases examined. As a general rule
they appeared after the patient had shown evidence of
several attacks of the disease. The psychoses occurred
in men between the ages of twenty-one and forty and in
women between forty-one and sixty. About ninety-five
per cent of the mental disorders were to be attributed
directly to the effect of the toxin. The remaining five
per cent represented individuals with a defective nervous
organization or were purely incidental complications.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Singer found peculiarities in make-up associated frequently
with a predisposition to pellagra. He also expressed
the opinion that chronic forms of "insanity" are
very rarely caused by the diseases.</p>

<p>Sandy<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> made a study of 160 cases at the state hospital
at Columbia, South Carolina, in 1916 based on a
classification of psychoses quite similar to the one now
in use. He found that thirty-five per cent of these belonged
to the infective exhaustive group. As a matter of
fact, this is the conclusion almost anyone would reach
from reading the observations of the earlier writers.
These cases were usually characterized by "more or less
marked delirium, being accompanied by some confusion
and disorientation, there frequently being also hallucinations
accompanied by more or less agitation and restlessness."
Physically he found, besides well marked symptoms
of pellagra, evidences of severe exhaustion, loss of
weight, emaciation, fever, sordes, anorexia, and typhoid
facies. "In the milder forms of these 'delirious pictures,'
as Singer calls them in his contribution to the
report of the Thompson-McFadden Pellagra Commission,
and as he pointed out, the periods of clouding (of consciousness)
may be quite brief and episodic. In such
cases in the intervals when the consciousness is practically
clear, the general attitude is one of symptomatic
depression." Sandy found characteristic manic-depressive
forms in eleven per cent of the series reviewed. The
depressed types were more common. Here he found retardation
of speech and action with a dearth of ideas. In
these cases he looks upon pellagra as being merely an
exciting etiological factor. The prognosis was not so
favorable, however, as it usually is in manic-depressive
psychoses, death often being due to the development of
central neuritis. In three per cent of the total he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
what could only be described as symptomatic depressions,
the emotional condition not being so marked as one would
expect in the manic-depressive group. In twelve per
cent a diagnosis of dementia praecox was made. In these
the pellagra was merely an incident and not an etiological
factor.</p>

<p>In several patients Sandy found a symptom complex
strongly suggestive of general paresis, thus confirming
the findings of other observers. These showed speech
and writing defects, absent or sluggish pupillary reaction,
swaying in the Romberg position, altered deep reflexes,
disorientation, memory disorders and other evidences
of deterioration. The Wassermann reactions were
negative in both the blood and spinal fluid tests and no
lymphocytosis was shown on cell counts. These cases
he thinks belong in the infective exhaustive group, and
usually die of central neuritis, a condition already referred
to and described originally by Turner and Meyer.
Sandy also found pellagra associated with various senile
psychoses. This group constituted ten per cent of those
studied. Fourteen per cent of the series he left unclassified
owing to lack of history, etc. Some of these showed
simple deterioration, others suggested neurasthenia, and
some, general paresis. Of the remaining cases three were
epileptic imbeciles, three, constitutional inferiority with
episodes of some kind, and three were not insane. Cases
associated with chorea and hysteria were also observed.
On analyzing these most important findings the assumption
would seem to be warranted that pellagra is an incident
in certain psychoses&mdash;(senility and dementia
praecox), that it is a precipitating factor in certain cases
(manic-depressive), and that the characteristic conditions
due to the disease are toxic and assume the infective-exhaustive
form, occasionally simulating general
paresis.</p>

<p>The policy of the Association's committee on statistics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
in the differentiation of these conditions is shown by
the following quotation on this subject from the last edition
of the manual:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The relation which various mental disturbances bear
to the disease pellagra is not yet settled. Cases of pellagra
occurring during the course of a well established
mental disease such as dementia praecox, manic-depressive
insanity, senile dementia, etc., should not be included
in this group. The mental disturbances which are apparently
most intimately connected with pellagra are certain
delirious or confused states (toxic-organ-like reactions)
arising during the course of a severe pellagra. These are
the cases which for the present should be placed in the
group of psychoses with pellagra."</p>

<p>A study of recent statistics would tend to show that
pellagra is not at this time a factor of importance in our
institutions. In Massachusetts in 1919 the admission
rate for this disease was .33 per cent. In New York
state hospitals during a period of eight years it was only
.03 per cent. In twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other
states it amounted to only 1.28 per cent. This includes
a number of institutions in the south. There were 263
cases (.37 per cent) in 70,987 first admissions to forty-eight
hospitals in sixteen different states. The admissions
reported from the southern institutions indicate
that pellagrous psychoses are comparatively infrequent
as a rule. During the year 1918 pellagra constituted
10.7 per cent of the admissions to the Columbia State
Hospital. During the biennial period of 1917 and 1918
the admission rate at the Arkansas State Hospital for
Nervous Diseases was 8.31 per cent. None were admitted
to the Spring Grove State Hospital at Catonsville, Maryland.
In 1919 the admission rate at the Western State
Hospital at Staunton, Virginia, was 1.14 per cent, at the
Central State Hospital, Petersburg, Virginia, 1.39 per
cent, and at the Georgia State Sanitarium at Milledgeville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
2.49 per cent. One and sixty-one hundredths per
cent of the admissions to the Louisiana State Hospital
during 1920 were diagnosed as psychoses due to pellagra.
Very few cases are reported in the northern institutions.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH OTHER SOMATIC
DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Mental disturbances of various types associated with
somatic conditions and not sufficiently characteristic or
circumscribed in their symptomatology to constitute
definite and separate psychoses have long been recognized.
That delirium is a complicating factor in certain
acute febrile diseases has been known for centuries.
Aristotle called attention to the occurrence of hallucinations
and illusions during the course of fevers. Hippocrates
referred frequently, not only to excitements,
but to delirium and phrenitis. The word "delirus" appears
in several places in the works of Horace and many
of the early authors apparently used this term as synonymous
with both mania and melancholia. That was
probably true of Sennert. Flemming in 1844 mentioned
fever delirium, hallucinatory and delusional clouded
states and an encephalitic form in addition to the various
alcoholic types. Sydenham referred to the mental
symptoms associated with malaria and Bright in his
original "Reports" described other delirious conditions
at some length. Sir Thomas Watson showed that the
brain was uninvolved at autopsy in the acute rheumatic
affections with apparent cerebral complications. Mental
symptoms have, of course, been associated for hundreds
of years with meningitic processes. Diabetic coma was
also recognized long since. Griesinger is said by some
to have been the first to call attention to the psychoses
caused by the acute infections. Post febrile mental disturbances
were, however, referred to by Sydenham, Baillarger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Westphal, Greenfield, Gubler and many others.
Delasiauve very elaborately described the psychoses associated
with typhoid fever in 1849. The mental disorders
accompanying gout were discussed at considerable
length by Sydenham and were referred to as early as
1699 by Philander Misaurus.</p>

<p>According to Bucknill and Tuke<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>, Misaurus made
the following very interesting suggestions in an article
entitled "The Honour of the Gout": "It would be
worth inquiry, whether the gout is not as effectual against
madness; and we may reasonably believe that it is so,
if upon examination, it should be found that there are
no gouty people in Bedlam; and then for the recovery
of these poor creatures to their wits again, it will not
need much consideration, whether they ought not to be
excused the hard blows which their barbarous keepers
deal them, and the Therapeutic method of Purging,
Bleeding, Cupping, Fluxing, Vomiting, Clystering,
Juleps, Apozemes, Powders, Confections, Epithemes,
Cataplasms, with which the more barbarous Doctors torment
them, and instead of their learned Torture, indulged
for a time only, a little intemperance as to wine,
or women, or so; or the scholar's delight of feeding
worthily, and sleeping heartily, whereby they might get
the Gout, and then their madness were cured." Clouston
described a very definite form of phthisical insanity.
Van der Kolk made the surprising statement that phthisis
and mania often alternated in regular cycles. Nasse
classified the mental conditions associated with fevers as
either resulting directly from the febrile disturbance,
constituting a prolongation of the delirium after the temperature
subsided, or developing during convalescence.</p>

<p>The German psychiatrists during the first part of the
nineteenth century were divided into two quite separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
groups. One of these insisted that all mental diseases
were purely psychic in origin, and the other, that they
were in all instances directly attributable to somatic disease
processes. The former school was ably represented
by Heinroth and Ideler and the latter by Jacobi, Nasse
and Friedreich. This led to a controversy which lasted
for many years. Heinroth's views were illustrated by
his statement<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> that "Insanity is the loss of moral
liberty. It never depends upon a physical cause; it is
not a disease of the body but of the mind&mdash;a sin.... The
man who has during his whole life before his eyes and
in his heart the image of God, has no reason to fear that
he will ever lose his reason.... Man possesses a certain
moral power which cannot be conquered by any physical
power, and which only falls under the weight of his
own faults.... From wrong doing springs all misfortune,
including the disorders of the mind." His principal
work was a "Lehrbuch der Seelenkunde," published
in Leipsic in 1818. The teachings of the psychic
school were summarized by von Feuchtersleben<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> as
follows:&mdash;"The mind is the immediate seat of the disease,
the bodily suffering is secondary. Mental disorders
may be clearly traced to their origin, Sin, Error, Passion.
Diseases of the brain, on the contrary, and of all the
organs, occur, even in their greatest intensity, without
mental disturbance, as also the latter without the former.
The psychical mode of cure is that which is properly
efficient; the somatic remedies in reality act psychically;
for instance through pain, diversion of the thoughts,
stupefaction, terror. Pathological anatomy has not discovered
any decided relation between disorganization of
the brain and mental disorders." In 1836 Friedreich<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264">
</a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
in opposing Heinroth's views outlined thirteen reasons
for believing that all psychic disorders were somatic in
origin:&mdash;"1. Because the mind cannot become diseased;
2. because the greater part of the causes producing those
conditions is somatic; 3. because in all mental disorders
there are somatic symptoms in addition; 4. because they
are too permanent for pure conditions of the mind;
5. because they are subject to cosmical and telluric
states; 6. because their crises always take place in a
material way; 7. because they are not infrequently removed
by strong material influences; 8. because the
somatic mode of cure alone has a direct sanatory effect,
the psychical at most an indirect effect on the body; 9.
because the occurrence of psychical indisposition on one
side only, must arise from the duality of the brain;
10. because the return of reason before death occurs
in cases not only of psychical, but likewise of somatic
diseases, and may be physically accounted for; 11. because
mental disorders correspond with the temperaments;
12. because it may be proved that there are psychical
conditions which depend on organic causes, and
are therefore very analogous to psychical disorders; 13.
because chronic delirium (mania) can be no other than
febrile." Absurd as such discussions may seem at this
time, they are no worse than the theological debates of
that day. As a matter of fact, they were no more futile
than the efforts still being made to classify the various
psychoses on some one common ground, for any other
than purely statistical purposes.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> divides the psychoses due to infection
into febrile delirium, infection delirium, acute confusional
states (amentia) and exhaustions. The result of
the infectious process, as he says, may be merely to
precipitate a manic-depressive psychosis, or an attack of
dementia praecox, general paresis or delirium tremens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
It may also be manifested in the form of a neuritis, myelitis,
encephalitis, or a meningitis. Bonhöffer in 1910
described several forms of "symptomatic psychoses" due
to infections and divided them into three main groups:
deliria, confusions and mental enfeeblements. He also
referred to epileptiform excitements, dream states, hallucinoses,
manic types and amentias either hallucinatory,
catatonic or incoherent in character.</p>

<p>Kraepelin speaks of several definite stages or forms
of febrile delirium. In the mildest of these there is a
feeling of discomfort with a sensation of fulness in the
head and a marked sensitiveness to external impressions.
In the second stage a suggestion of clouding becomes apparent
and perception is distorted by hallucinations and
illusions. There is an increased activity of the mental
processes and consciousness soon assumes a dreamlike
form. Hallucinations and illusions are mixed with realities.
The restlessness increases and excitements or
depressive moods may precede the appearance of the
third stage. In this there is a more pronounced disturbance
of consciousness with disorientation, confusion,
flight of ideas, and variable emotional reactions, sometimes
with actual manic manifestations. Evidences of
stuporous tendencies may appear at times. In the fourth
stage a state of weakness develops, with picking at the
bed clothes, tremulous movements and a senseless muttering
of words and syllables. This terminates in complete
coma. In smallpox, scarlet fever, erysipelas, articular
rheumatism and pneumonia there are often sudden
confused excited states, while in typhoid fever stuporous
delirium is the rule. Hendriks found the mental symptoms
in typhoid greater during convalescence and not
closely related to the febrile reaction. He describes a
marked disturbance of attention with little involvement
of apprehension or comprehension, but marked loss of
mental capacity and sometimes a tendency to confabulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Visual hallucinations and loss of sleep are common
symptoms. Often there is restlessness, talkativeness, indifference,
carelessness and disturbances of volition. In
articular rheumatism and scarlet fever, according to
Kraepelin, delirium sometimes develops with sudden rise
of temperature. Restlessness, talking in the sleep, volubility
or dulness precede an unusually violent delirium,
sometimes terminating in stupor and death. The basis
of these conditions in all cases is the toxic infection
causing the fever, changes in metabolism, circulatory
disturbances and an involvement of various organs, particularly
the brain. A rapid and considerable rise of
temperature usually causes delirium in typhoid, smallpox
and erysipelas while it has no such effect usually in
tuberculosis. This disturbance is a direct result of the
influence of the toxins on the cortex. Alcoholism constitutes
another well-known and common cause. In seventy
per cent of the cases the duration was less than one week
and the delirium disappeared with the fall in temperature.
Some cases terminate in infection delirium or
they may precipitate genuine attacks of manic-depressive
insanity, dementia praecox or general paresis.</p>

<p>The so-called acute alteration of Nissl was a very
common change found in the cortical cells at autopsy.
This very generally involved the entire cortex. Kraepelin
describes another characteristic alteration observed
in cases of typhoid delirium. The Nissl bodies are
clumped together in the periphery, and are deeply
stained, the processes also being unusually dark. Some
cells show a shrunken nucleus with swollen, lightly
stained bodies. Around these neurones there are usually
large accumulations of elongated glia cells.</p>

<p>In the infection delirium, so called, the mental disturbance
develops in a case where there is no hyperpyrexia
or where at least there is no relation between the
psychosis and the temperature. A restless excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
ushers in the attack. Pressure in the head, mental dulness,
depressed or sometimes cheerful moods, uneasiness,
disturbed sleep and anxious dreams are common symptoms.
Later a disturbance of consciousness appears and
a special type known as "initial delirium" may develop.
This is a common occurrence in typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Aschaffenburg described two forms of initial delirium.
The first is a restless condition of clouding with
hallucinations and delusions. The second form, which
may develop from the first, shows active mental excitement.
Mild in its onset, a confusional delirious state soon
develops with flight of ideas, hallucinations, delusions, and
marked anxiety. An initial delirium of this type often
occurs in smallpox. This assumes a particularly severe
form with a tendency to suicide and violence, strongly
resembling epileptic dream states. Seizures and epileptiform
convulsions may occur. The delirium usually develops
from the third to the fifth day of the disease and
mental enfeeblement sometimes follows. The attack
usually lasts from several days to a week. It may continue
as a fever delirium. About forty or fifty per cent
die. Nissl in one case found a marked congestion of the
vessels of the cortex, with an increase in the number
of leucocytes, and a widespread destruction of the neurones.
The cell bodies were swollen and the chromatin
lumps destroyed. Karyokinetic changes were noted in
the glia cells.</p>

<p>More or less similar delirious states occur in the
course of intermittent malarial fevers. These usually
take the form of a marked anxious excitement, often with
stupor or a tendency to violence. The attacks begin
suddenly, last only a few hours and end in sleep. Convulsions
are frequently observed. These conditions occur
in the quotidian or tertian types but rarely in the quartan.
The delirium precedes a febrile disturbance or may
take its place. It is apparently due to an accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of plasmodia in the cerebral vessels. In influenza, restlessness,
confusion, anxious excitement or hallucinatory
deliria may be associated with a low temperature. Polyneuritic
manifestations have also been observed. The
disturbance is undoubtedly caused by the influenza bacillus
or the action of its toxins on the cortex. Abscesses
are found in some instances. Deliria with phthisis are
rare unless there is a tubercular meningitis. In the septic
infections, conditions with marked clouding are often
observed, and are to be attributed to embolism, metastases,
etc. Muscular weakness, aphasia, perseveration
and convulsions may be present in these cases. Infection
delirium also occurs in chorea. This takes the form of a
clouded dreamlike state with confusion of thought at
times, hallucinations, delusions, and emotional excitement
accompanied by characteristic choreiform movements.
Apprehension, as a rule, is unimpaired, but
attention is disturbed and the patients are forgetful and
distractible. They do not have a clear grasp on their
surroundings. Occasional hallucinations appear. The
mood is anxious, excited, fearful or irritable, sometimes
with outbursts of anger or threats of suicide. The choreiform
attacks are aggravated and speech is affected. The
reflexes are decreased and muscular weakness develops.
The pupils are dilated and sleep is interfered with to a
marked degree. This excitement lasts for a short time
only, but often recurs. In nine per cent of the cases
(Kleist) death results from heart failure, septic infection
or other intercurrent diseases. Wassermann and
Westphal demonstrated streptococci in the brain in several
cases of chorea. Others have reported staphylococci
in the blood. Choreic delirium is usually associated with
endocarditis or rheumatic infections, and occurs in the
acute type but not in the Huntington variety of the
disease.</p>

<p>Delirious excitements, according to Kraepelin, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
occur in acute cerebrospinal inflammatory processes and
may be due to furunculosis or caused by infections from
the mouth or the intestinal tract. There is nothing particularly
characteristic in such conditions aside from their
severity. They have been collectively described under
the designation of "acute delirium." Their differentiation
depends entirely on the demonstration of the
source of infection. The anatomical basis for these disturbances
is always found in the cerebral cortex. The
pia is infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells and
leucocytes are found in the perivascular spaces. There
is also a proliferation of the glia. The "grave" alteration
of Nissl is often demonstrable. After the infectious
process passes its maximum intensity and the delirium
disappears, "residual" delusions may remain with a
clear sensorium. These may last for several days or
even weeks. They frequently follow typhoid fever. Occasionally
hallucinations of sight and hearing persist in
the same way.</p>

<p>"Collapse delirium" was first described by Hermann
Weber in 1866. It takes the form of a stuporous state
with confusion of thought, dreamy hallucinations, flight
of ideas, an unstable emotional condition and an active
motor excitement. The onset is usually sudden, following
a period of sleeplessness and restlessness. Disorientation
occurs early and consciousness is markedly
clouded. Phantastic hallucinations and illusions are frequent.
Excitement and confusion are also prominent
symptoms. Flight of ideas is common and the patient
often sings or expresses himself exclusively in verse or
rhymes. Senseless and rapidly changing delusions are
noted. The mood is elated, erotic, anxious or irritable,
with outbursts of anger. Motor excitement is conspicuous
and there is no sleep. Usually food is refused and
nutrition disturbed with a great reduction of bodily
weight. This condition is of short duration, usually not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
more than a few days, often terminating in sleep in
favorable cases. Only a confused recollection of events
remains on recovery. Collapse delirium, according to
Kraepelin, is purely an infectious process and often occurs
in pneumonia, erysipelas and influenza, following the
subsidence of the active symptoms of the disease. It occasionally
complicates articular rheumatism and scarlet
fever. The characteristic features in erysipelas are hallucinations
and delusions of a delirious type, while
clouded states, confusional excitements and flight of ideas
are more common after pneumonia. The symptoms usually
develop after the temperature falls and other evidences
of weakness are present. Kraepelin, however,
recognizes infection as the only cause at this time, although
he previously described these as exhaustive conditions.</p>

<p>Acute confusional states or amentia were described by
Meynert in 1881. These are characterized by a clouding
of consciousness with multiform manifestations of excitement
both sensory and motor. Amentia is one of the
sequelae of infectious diseases. It takes the form of a
subacute development of a dreamlike confusion with
hallucinations, illusions and motor excitement lasting
usually for several months. It is very closely related to
collapse delirium and the hallucinatory insanity of Hoche,
Fürstner and others. The early symptoms are sleeplessness
and unrest. The patients become anxious, forgetful,
develop a fear of death, and cannot control their
thoughts, complaining of dulness and confusion of mind.
A difficult comprehension of external impressions develops.
They may be attentive and seriously troubled
at not being able properly to grasp their surroundings.
A decided uncertainty and restlessness results. Everything
seems changed or false. There is at first a feeling
of inadequacy and a profound disturbance of thought
which develops into a well defined confusional condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
A dreamlike state follows, sometimes with a tendency to
fabrications. Rhymes, phrases and words may be repeated
frequently. There is a tendency towards distractibility
and flight of ideas with vague thoughts of
persecution. Hallucinations sometimes become apparent,
and illusions appear. The mood is usually one of
irritable anxiety, suspicion and mistrust, seldom with
complete dulness. Occasional outbursts of anger take
place. A restless behavior is noted as a rule. Sometimes
suicidal tendencies occur and mild stuporous states
follow.</p>

<p>In another group of cases depression is an especially
prominent feature as occasionally happens after typhoid
fever; or states of excitement may exist with a flight of
ideas and delusions of grandeur. Before the febrile disturbance
has disappeared signs of restlessness are noted.
Orientation is soon lost, apprehension is disturbed, the
patient becomes distractible and begins to show hallucinations.
Ideas of grandeur develop and fabrications
are conspicuous and extravagant. The mood is angry
and irritable, sometimes cheerful or elated, but very
changeable. Restlessness, volubility, flight of ideas,
senseless rhyming, confused writing and tendencies to
sing, etc., soon appear. The sleep is very much disturbed.
Very little nourishment is taken or it is refused entirely.
Bodily weight is greatly reduced. The reflexes are usually
increased, the pulse slow and the temperature
subnormal. The duration of the disease is usually not
more than from two to six months. Amentia usually
follows typhoid, articular rheumatism, smallpox and
cholera, and occasionally occurs after pneumonia. Symptoms
invariably develop after the fever has subsided.
After typhoid the characteristic features are excitement
with hallucinations, delusions and variable moods; after
articular rheumatism, disturbance of apprehension, restlessness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
depression or even stupor; and after phthisis,
hallucinations with preservation of consciousness and
slight confusion.</p>

<p>Light forms of the infectious exhaustions, according
to Kraepelin, may appear after convalescence from the
more severe illnesses. The patient does not make a good
recovery, is exhausted, cannot think clearly, tires easily
and is not able to read or write letters. Mental activity
is weakened and the patient remains in bed, apathetic and
indifferent. Consciousness, orientation and perception
are undisturbed, although hallucinations may appear
when the eyes are closed or noises in the ears may be
noticed. The mood is gloomy, hopeless, and sometimes
irritable, with sudden attacks of anxiety at night. The
patient becomes suspicious and has fears of death or
poisoning. Hypochondriacal feelings with self-accusation
may develop. Food may be refused and suicidal attempts
occur. Some cases are reserved and quiet, even
stuporous, expressing only a few delusional ideas at
times. Sleep and appetite are affected and weight lost
as a consequence. These lighter forms usually follow
influenza, articular rheumatism, whooping cough, tuberculosis
or chorea. The duration is ordinarily brief&mdash;a
few weeks or months, followed by recovery. In some instances
the disease may progress to a complete enfeeblement
of the mental processes.</p>

<p>The exhaustive conditions in a large group of more
severe cases are ushered in by a delirium or confusional
state with a depressed mood. There is first a slight
anxiety. Self-accusation and persecutory ideas appear
early. Hallucinations of hearing and vision develop.
The patients soon become clouded, inattentive, show difficulty
of thought and loss of memory, with mental dulness.
All grasp upon their surroundings is lost, they fail to
recognize members of the family, and answer questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
unintelligently. They have no appreciation of their condition
and no memory for events. The mood is indifferent,
apathetic or whining. It may be irritable, quarrelsome
or violent. Usually they lie in bed and are entirely
apathetic. Sometimes they show automatic movements
and have to be fed. The conversation is often
incoherent and meaningless. They are inclined to be
emotional. Sleep is usually interfered with and they are
restless at night. The appetite is lost. Occasionally evidences
of brain lesions appear with paralyses, speech
disturbance or epileptiform seizures. The duration is
usually a matter of a number of months. At autopsy
grave cell alterations and glia reactions are common.
Rod cells are also found. Endothelial proliferation is
frequently observed in the vessel walls. Some cases terminate
in a chronic condition which may improve somewhat
in time. There may be a persistent emotional and
mental enfeeblement with indifference, loss of memory,
lack of judgment and impairment of will. These "acute
dementias" represent the terminal stages of cortical infectious
processes. They have been observed after typhoid,
rheumatism, erysipelas, cholera, smallpox and
malaria. Usually after tubercular peritonitis or articular
rheumatism there is a simple mental enfeeblement, while
erysipelas is usually accompanied by mild excitements
and an elated mood. The typhoid cases usually showed
irritability, with outbursts of anger and confusional
states with hallucinations and delusions. They occasionally
terminate in more chronic conditions with permanent
deterioration.</p>

<p>After typhoid, influenza and septic infections, Korsakow's
"cerebropathica psychica toxaemica" sometimes
occurs. This is the polyneuritic psychosis similar to
that caused by alcohol. There is, however, a delirium or
stupor at the same time.</p>

<p class="p2b">The post-rheumatic psychoses have been studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
exhaustively by Knauer.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Stuporous attacks were found
in ninety-three per cent of his cases, following acute
infections. He describes four groups showing psychotic
<span class="no-break">manifestations:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p9">
1. Anxious delirious excitements followed by stupor.<br />
2. Excitements alternating with stupor.<br />
3. Stuporous depression throughout.<br />
4. Amentia-like excitements throughout.<br />
</p>

<p class="p10">The essential feature of Knauer's study was an analysis
of post-rheumatic stupors. He describes these as clouded
or dream states "not different from physiological sleep
and the ordinary artificial narcoses." In them he sees
a disturbance of apprehension, an interference with intellectual
processes, a retention defect, and a loss of the
power of attention. Catalepsy was found to be present
in the majority of his cases. The loss of affect was described
as being more complete than in manic-depressive
psychoses. He speaks of the mood as sad, depressed,
anxious, but above all, changeable.</p>

<p>Generally speaking this group of psychoses due to
somatic disease is one which requires further study. We
have comparatively little statistical information on the
subject as yet. The differentiation of these conditions
as outlined in the Association's statistical manual is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Under this heading are brought together those mental
disorders which appear to depend directly upon some
physical disturbance or somatic disease not already provided
for in the foregoing groups.</p>

<p>"In the types designated below under (a) to (e) inclusive,
we have essentially deliria or states of confusion
arising during the course of an infectious disease or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
association with a condition of exhaustion or a toxaemia.
The mental disturbance is apparently the result of interference
with brain nutrition or the unfavorable action
of certain deleterious substances, poisons or toxins, on
the central nervous system. The clinical pictures met
with are extremely varied. The delirium may be marked
by severe motor excitement and incoherence of utterance,
or by multiform hallucinations with deep confusion
or a dazed, bewildered condition; epileptiform attacks,
catatonic-like symptoms, stupor, etc., may occur. In
classifying these psychoses a difficult problem arises in
many cases if attempts are made to distinguish between
infection and exhaustion as etiological factors. For
statistical reports the following differentiations should
be made:</p>

<p class="p1d">"Under (a) 'Delirium with infectious diseases'
place the <em>initial deliria</em> which develop during the prodromal
or incubation period or before the febrile stage as
in some cases of typhoid, small-pox, malaria, etc.; the
<em>febrile deliria</em> which seem to bear a definite relation to
the rise in temperature; the <em>post-febrile deliria</em> of the
period of defervescence including the so-called 'collapse
delirium.'</p>

<p>"Under (b) 'Post-infectious psychoses' are to be
grouped deliria, the mild forms of mental confusion, or
the depressive, irritable, suspicious reactions which occur
during the period of convalescence from infectious
diseases. Physical asthenia and prostration are undoubtedly
important factors in these conditions and
differentiation from 'exhaustion deliria' must depend
chiefly on the history and obvious close relationship to
the preceding infectious disease. (Some cases which fail
to recover show a peculiar mental enfeeblement.) In
this group should be classed the 'cerebropathica psychica
toxaemica' or the non-alcoholic polyneuritic psychoses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
following an infectious disease as typhoid, influenza,
septicaemia, etc.</p>

<p>"Under (c) 'Exhaustion deliria' are to be classed
psychoses in which physical exhaustion, not associated
with or the result of an infectious disease, is the chief
precipitating cause of the mental disorder, <i>e.g.</i>, hemorrhage,
severe physical over-exertion, deprivation of food,
prolonged insomnia, debility from wasting disease, etc.</p>

<p>"Of the psychoses which occur with diseases of the
ductless glands, the best known are the thyroigenous
mental disorders. Disturbance of the pituitary or of the
adrenal function is often associated with mental symptoms.</p>

<p>"According to the etiology and symptoms the following
types should therefore be specified under 'Psychoses
with Other Somatic Diseases':</p>

<p class="p9">
"(a) Delirium with infectious disease (specify)<br />
"(b) Post-infectious psychosis (specify)<br />
"(c) Exhaustion delirium<br />
"(d) Delirium of unknown origin<br />
"(e) Cardio-renal disease<br />
"(f) Diseases of the ductless glands (specify)<br />
"(g) Other diseases or conditions (to be specified)."<br />

<span class="st">THE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The manic-depressive psychoses as first described by
Kraepelin are of comparatively recent origin. The history
of the clinical entities included in this new grouping,
however, may be easily traced back to the earliest days
of psychiatry. Although these terms were not used perhaps
as they came to be later, mania and melancholia
were, as has already been shown, known in the Hippocratic
era, over four hundred years before the time of
Christ. They were referred to again in the works of
Aretaeus in the first century A. D. and were recognized by
Celsus, Caelius Aurelianus and Galen. Daniel Sennert<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
of Wittenberg (1572-1637) defined melancholia as a
"delirium or deprival of imagination and reason, without
fever, with fear and sadness, arising from dark and
melancholy animal spirits, and occasioning corresponding
phantoms." Mania he described as a "delirium or
deprival of imagination and reason without fear, but, on
the contrary, with audacity, temerity, anger, and ferocity,
without fever, arising from a fervent and fiery disposition."</p>

<p>Sydenham<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> recommended bleeding, followed by
purgation, as the treatment indicated for mania:&mdash;"Thus
the humours, which in mania would invade the citadel
of the brain, are gradually drawn off towards the lower
parts, a fresh bias being given to them."</p>

<p>Thomas Willis<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> made some very significant references
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
to the relation existing between mania and melancholia,
in the seventeenth century:&mdash;"After melancholia
we have to treat of mania, which has so many relations
to the former, that the two disorders often follow each
other, the former changing into the latter, and inversely.
The melancholic diathesis, indeed, carried to its highest
degree, causes frenzy, and frenzy subsiding changes frequently
into melancholia (atrabiliar diathesis). These
two disorders, like fire and smoke, often mask and replace
each other, and if we may say that in melancholia
the brain and the animal spirit are obscured by smoke
and black darkness, mania may be compared to a great
fire destined to disperse and to illuminate it." Morgagni,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
"the father of pathology," also saw a close
relation between these two conditions as is shown by the
following quotation from his "De Sedibus et Causis Morborum;"
etc., in 1761. "Melancholia," he says, "is so
nearly allied to mania, that the diseases frequently alternate,
and pass into one another; so that you frequently
see physicians in doubt whether they should call a patient
a melancholiac or a maniac, taciturnity and fear alternating
with audacity in the same patient; on which account,
when I have asked under what kind of delirium the insane
persons have laboured whose heads I was about
to dissect, I have had the more patience in receiving answers
which were frequently ambiguous and sometimes
antagonistic to each other, yet, which were, perhaps, true
in the long course of the insanity." Flemming<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> in
1844 described a "dysthymia atra" (melancholia), a
"dysthymia candida" (cheerful dysthymia) or "melancholia
hilaris" characterized by elation with playfulness
and a "tendency to see everything in the most pleasant
and cheerful light" as well as a "dysthymia mutabilis,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
an alternating variety involving both of the above forms.
He also spoke of a "dysthymia sparsa" (apathica) or
"melancholia attonita," and a "vesania maniaca" or
mania which he divided into the acute, delirious, alcoholic,
affective, and puerperal types, together with an
"occult amentia" embracing all of these forms. Griesinger<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
in 1845 called attention to the fact that "the
transition of melancholia into mania, and the alternation
of these two forms, are very common." In 1851
Falret, senior, first described circular insanity in his lectures
at the Salpêtrière, quoted by Tuke<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> as follows:&mdash;"We
have also to mention another case of intermittence
observed between the periods of remission and excitement
in the forme circulaire des maladies mentales." "It
is a special form which we call 'circular' and which
consists, not as has been frequently said, in a change of
mania into melancholia separated by a more or less prolonged
lucid interval, but in the change from maniacal
excitement&mdash;simple overactivity of all the faculties&mdash;into
mental torpor."</p>

<p class="p2b">In 1854 at the Academy of Medicine in Paris Falret
presented his "Mémoire sur la folie circulaire, forme de
maladie mentale caractérisée par la reproduction successive
et régulière de l'état maniaque, de l'état mélancolique,
et d'un intervalle lucide plus ou moins prolongé."
In the same year Baillarger described his "Folie à double
forme," summarized by him in a Bulletin of the Academy
of Medicine as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p8a">"(1) Besides monomania, melancholia, and mania,
there exists a special form of insanity characterized
by two regular periods, one of depression, the other
of excitement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p class="p8a">(2) This form of insanity: (1) presents itself in isolated
attacks; (2) reproduces itself in intermissions;
(3) the attacks may follow each other without interruption.</p>

<p class="p8a">(3) The duration of the attacks varies from two days
to one year.</p>

<p class="p8a">(4) When the attacks are short, the transition from
the first to the second period takes place suddenly,
and generally during sleep. It takes place slowly
and gradually when the attacks are prolonged.</p>

<p class="p8a">(5) In the latter case, the patients seem to enter into
a state of convalescence at the end of the first period,
but this return to health is incomplete; after a fortnight,
a month, six weeks or more, the second period
breaks out."</p>

<p class="p10">This was described as "Folie à double phase" by Bellod,
"Folie à formes alternés" by Delaye, "Délire à formes
alternés" by Legrand du Saulle, "Die cyclische Psychose"
by Ludwig Kirn and "Das circuläre Irresein"
by Krafft-Ebing.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the American Association in 1886 the
classification of the British Medico-Psychological Association
was adopted with the omission of moral insanity
and the addition of toxic insanity. This included the
following types of mania:&mdash;Recent, chronic, recurrent,
à potu, puerperal and senile, and classified melancholia
as recent, chronic, recurrent, puerperal and senile. In
his "Clinical Lectures on Mental Disease" Clouston in
1898 described eight varieties of melancholia and six of
mania, not including alternating forms. Kahlbaum in
1882, reverting apparently to the phraseology of Flemming,
spoke of dysthymia, hyperthymia and mixed or circular
forms&mdash;cyclothymia. Many of the conditions afterwards
classified under dementia praecox he described as
"vesania typica."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that, based somewhat on the conceptions
of Griesinger, states of mental excitement were
generally characterized as mania and all depressions as
melancholia. As has been shown, the view that there
was some definite relation between these two conditions
had been gaining ground for many years and culminated
in the "circular insanity" concept. In the meanwhile
over fifty varieties of mania and thirty forms of melancholia
were described by various authors. Aside from
an emotional exaltation and increased psychomotor activity,
few definite characteristics were insisted upon
in a consideration of mania. There was almost invariably
a disturbance of sleep but always with a sense of
well-being and no feeling of exhaustion. The milder type
of the disease was often referred to as "hypomania."
In the more severe forms varying grades of violence developed.
There was at times a clouding of the sensorium,
a temporary appearance of hallucinations of sight and
hearing, delusions of a persecutory or grandiose nature
and incoherence of speech. Impulsive acts occasionally
were noted during the height of the excitement. These
attacks were frequently preceded by brief periods of depression.
Many cases made rather early recoveries&mdash;others,
however, were spoken of as having reached a
chronic stage. Many terminated in dementia. These
very often showed stereotypies, verbigeration, impulsive
excitements, mannerisms and other symptoms now held
to be characteristic of dementia praecox. Melancholia
was looked upon as including all emotional depressions
with hallucinations and delusions as the prominent symptoms.
The mental state was essentially one of sadness
but with fear, agitation and anxiety appearing at times.
There was, however, no attempt at any differentiation
between psychomotor retardation with genuine depression
and apathetic states or actual mental dulness. Mutism
and resistiveness were common. A refusal of food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
was rather to be expected. Stuporous states with muscular
rigidity frequently occurred. Various physical
changes were described. Cyanosis of the extremities was
emphasized, with loss of weight and a lowered temperature.
Many of the cases were untidy in their habits.
Brief initial attacks of excitement were mentioned as usually
ushering in the disease. These depressions recovered,
became chronic, lasting for years, or terminated in
a partial or complete dementia. These were in substance
the views of practically all of the earlier writers on insanity.</p>

<p>Sankey<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> in 1884 included in his idiopathic psychoses
due to pathological conditions, general paresis
and "ordinary insanity." "This is the disease which
in its course presents such varying phenomena, and has
thus given occasion for multiplying the names." Prominent
in this group were the various forms of mania and
melancholia and it undoubtedly included dementia praecox.
"Like other diseases it may be artificially divided
into separate stages, and this is useful for facilitating
description, but such artificial divisions must not be
looked upon as different species of disease." ... "Thus,
a case in the primary attack commences by symptoms of
melancholy; these may, when successfully treated, pass
off, and the patient recover, or the melancholic stage may
be aggravated, and the patient die in this stage;&mdash;the
disease may exhibit symptoms of violence and become
acutely maniacal. There is no ground on this account
to say, that the patient has a new disease, any more
than the appearance of an eruption in an eruptive disease
would be the inauguration of a different kind of
malady." Although obviously he had no idea as to
the fundamental differences between manic-depressive
insanity and dementia praecox, he unquestionably was
one of the first to emphasize the fact that mania and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
melancholia were often definite stages of one disease
process.</p>

<p>In 1896 Kraepelin described melancholia as essentially
an involutional condition. Under the heading of
periodic constitutional disorders he included mania, circular
and depressive forms, the mania, melancholia, and
circular insanity of other writers. Schüle<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> in 1886
described circular, periodical and alternating psychoses.
In 1894 Ziehen<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> included in his classification under
the heading of combined psychoses a "melancholisch-maniakalisches"
form in addition to mania and melancholia,
which he spoke of as affective psychoses.</p>

<p>It was not until 1899 that these conditions were clearly
differentiated by Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and the purely emotional
and recoverable forms separated clinically from the deteriorative
processes which he has associated with dementia
praecox. The former he described as manic-depressive
psychoses, which included mania, melancholia
and a majority of the circular and alternating types previously
described. This delimitation had a prognostic
as well as an important symptomatic significance. The
emotional excitements were characterized by an increased
psychomotor activity, with a flight of ideas and distractibility,
usually associated with a clear sensorium. Graver
forms were, however, recognized, with a clouding of consciousness,
and disorientation, occasionally terminating
in stupor. Hallucinations and delusions when present
were not prominent symptoms. The depressions were
characterized by an emotional disturbance in the form of
sadness with difficulty in thinking, associated with marked
retardation in speech and a motor inhibition. More advanced
stages showed clouding, disorientation, stuporous
phases and hallucinations. He also recognized alternating
or circular as well as mixed types. The prognostic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
importance of this clinical grouping was the tendency
towards a complete recovery from the individual attack,
with, however, an extreme probability later of a recurrence,
the subsequent attacks assuming either form of
the disease. As a rule Kraepelin found that the unfavorable
types formerly included in the manias and melancholiac,
together with the hebephrenia and katatonia of
his fifth edition, presented the definite characteristics
of the disease which he described as dementia praecox.
His views have been modified from time to time. For
instance, he at one time excluded the involutional and
anxiety psychoses from his manic-depressive group.
Later these were included. In his last edition he has described
depressed and agitated forms of dementia praecox,
which would strongly suggest that his lines of demarcation
were not so clear as he believed them to be in 1899.
Of the manic-depressive psychoses he says, "Manic depressive
insanity as described in this chapter includes on
the one hand the entire domain of the so-called periodic
and circular insanities, on the other, simple mania, the
larger part of the disease process described as melancholia
and also a not inconsiderable number of cases of
Amentia. Finally we include certain mild morbid emotional
states, some periodical, some continuous, which
heretofore have been looked upon either as introductory
to more severe disturbances or as belonging, without being
sharply circumscribed, to the domain of individual
makeup. As years go by I have become more and more
convinced that these all represent manifestations of one
disease process." The following classification of manic-depressive
psychoses was shown in Kraepelin's last edition
<span class="no-break">(1913):&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p10">Manic types:</p>

<p>Hypomania, Acute mania, Delusional and Delirious
forms.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p class="p10">Depressive types:</p>

<p>Melancholia simplex, Melancholia gravis, Stupor, Paranoid,
Phantastic and Delirious forms.</p>

<p class="p10">Mixed types:</p>

<p class="p9">
Depressive mania.<br />
Excited depressions.<br />
Mania with poverty of thought.<br />
Manic stupor.<br />
Depression with flight of ideas.<br />
Retarded mania.<br />
</p>

<p class="p10">The mixed and atypical forms are of special importance,
as they occupy the middle ground between the classical
types of manic-depressive insanity and dementia praecox.
It is here that difficulties arise and errors in diagnosis
are made. They have never received sufficient attention
until recently. In practice many of these have undoubtedly
been classed with the dementia praecox group. The
first of these as described by Kraepelin is depressive or
anxious mania&mdash;characterized by a depressive mood with
anxiety and excitement and, at the same time, a flight of
ideas. The patients are distractible, observant of everything
in their surroundings, and complain that thoughts
obtrude themselves upon them. Some have a mania for
scribbling. Often there are delusions of persecution, sin,
and hypochondriacal ideas. The mood is one of anxiety
or despair. Impulsive acts are occasionally observed.
They are inclined to weep, wring their hands, pull out
their hair and throw themselves on the ground.</p>

<p>Instead of a flight of ideas there may be poverty of
thought and retardation with excitement&mdash;an "excited depression."
The patients may be very wordy and monotonous
in expression but are entirely clear as to their
surroundings. The mood is anxious and tearful, often
with delusions. There is a considerable excitement, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
not of such a stormy character as in the depressive or
anxious mania.</p>

<p>Mania with poverty of thought, an "unproductive"
form, shows a more cheerful mood but without a flight
of ideas. This form Kraepelin speaks of as a common
one. Speech is monotonous and expressionless. The
patients present almost an appearance of feeblemindedness,
although exceedingly variable and changeable. The
mood is cheerful and sometimes irritable. The excitement
is shown by jumping around, making faces, etc., but
without any occupational activity. This alternates with
periods of quiet when but little is said. They show no
desire to occupy themselves in anything useful. Sudden
outbursts of violence often occur.</p>

<p>Stuporous, almost cataleptic forms with occasional delusions
of a hypochondriacal type, fairly well oriented
and with a clear sensorium, are spoken of as "manic
stupor." This is interrupted by excitement and violence,
with laughter, witty remarks and even eroticism.
They often have a clear memory of all occurrences. This
stuporous type may appear suddenly in an ordinary
manic attack, or take place between excitements and depressions.</p>

<p>In the course of an ordinary depression a flight of
ideas may also replace the usual retardation&mdash;"depression
with flight of ideas." The delusions are interspersed
with cheerful thoughts and the patients show certain
activities and an interest in their surroundings, although
still depressed and hopeless. When they begin to talk
they complain of an inability to control their thoughts.
There is an inhibition of speech but not of thought. They
may be quite prolific in writing, and may show a characteristic
flight of ideas. This condition often merges
into genuine excitement.</p>

<p>Kraepelin also speaks of an inhibited or "retarded
mania," showing a cheerful mood with flight of ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
and psychomotor retardation. These eases are excited,
distractible, inclined to witticisms with "klang associations,"
but lie quietly in bed. He believes that there
is an inner tension manifesting itself at times in acts of
violence. Kraepelin also speaks of various other mixtures
of depression, anxiety and excitement. Specht
has described an "irascible mania" (Zorntobsucht) and
Stransky a bashful mania (verschämte Manie). Dreyfus
has described a partial inhibition or retardation (partiellen
Hemmung). Hecker is responsible for a "grumbling"
or faultfinding variety of mania (nörgelnden Formen
der Manie). In any event, Kraepelin's conceptions
constitute a distinct advance and have materially clarified
a much involved confusion of entities which seem to
warrant complete differentiation. His views have, of
course, not been universally accepted. The English
school of psychiatrists has been slow in expressing its
approval of his theories. No textbook of late years has
appeared, however, in this country that has failed to
recognize the manic-depressive psychoses practically as
Kraepelin originally described them.</p>

<p>The psychological mechanisms of manic-depressive
insanity have been studied exhaustively by Karl Abraham
and other psychoanalysts. He looks upon retardation
as a symbol of death and interprets it as a defensive
reaction, the patient taking refuge in a retarded state
to avoid contact with the outer world. The ideas of poverty
associated with depressions he considered as symbolic
of an inability to love and occurring in individuals
who have not obtained sexual gratification in a normal
way. When repression is no longer possible mania ensues
and the patient enters upon a new existence, all
instinctive inhibition being lost. The flight of ideas he
looks upon as a reestablishment of infantilism. He suggests
these views, however, as tentative. The delusions
of the manic-depressive psychoses have been interpreted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
as an expression of repressed complexes. White<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
would explain these mechanisms as follows:&mdash;"Manic-depressive
psychosis is the type of extroversion reaction.
That is, the patients instead of turning within
themselves (introversion) try to escape their difficulties
(conflict) by a 'flight into reality.' This flight into reality
is the manic phase of the psychosis with its flight of
ideas, distractibility and increased psychomotor activity
during which the patient seems to be at the mercy almost
of his environment having his attention diverted by every
passing stimulus. The great activity can be understood
as a defense mechanism. The patient appears, by his
constant activity to be covering every possible avenue of
approach which might by any possibility touch his sore
point (complex) and so he rushes wildly from this possible
source of danger to that meanwhile keeping up a
stream of diverting activities. He is at once running
away from his conflict&mdash;into reality&mdash;and trying to adequately
defend every possible approach.... This
method I have described as a 'flight into reality' which
is the characteristic of the manic phase, while the failure
to deal adequately with the difficulty is manifested by the
depression of the depressive phase. In the depression
the defenses have broken down and the patient is overwhelmed
by a sense of his moral turpitude (self-accusatory
delusions). This sense of being sinful is the conscious
appreciation of tendencies which should have been
left behind to become a part of the historical past (the
unconscious) in the course of the development of the
psyche but which still demand expression.... The benign
character of the manic-depressive group of psychoses
is explained because of their extroverted mechanism.
Reality is the normal direction for the libido and
because the direction is normal they more readily result
in recovery."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association, in its manual
designed for the assistance of hospitals for mental diseases
in the compilation of statistical data, makes the following
suggestions as to the delimitation of the manic-depressive
<span class="no-break">psychoses:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"This group comprises the essentially benign affective
psychoses, mental disorders which fundamentally are
marked by emotional oscillations and a tendency to recurrence.
Various psychotic trends, delusions, illusions
and hallucinations, clouded states, stupor, etc., may be
added. To be distinguished are:</p>

<p>"The <em>manic</em> reaction with its feeling of well-being (or
irascibility), flight of ideas and over-activity.</p>

<p>"The <em>depressive</em> reaction with its feeling of mental
and physical insufficiency, a despondent, sad or hopeless
mood and in severe depressions, retardation and inhibition;
in some cases the mood is one of uneasiness and
anxiety, accompanied by restlessness.</p>

<p>"The <em>mixed</em> reaction, a combination of manic and depressive
symptoms.</p>

<p>"The <em>stupor</em> reaction with its marked reduction in
activity, depression, ideas of death, and often dream-like
hallucinations; sometimes mutism, drooling and muscular
symptoms suggestive of the catatonic manifestations of
dementia praecox, from which, however, these manic-depressive
stupors are to be differentiated.</p>

<p>"An attack is called <em>circular</em> when, as is often the case,
one phase is followed immediately by another phase, e.g.,
a manic reaction passes over into a depressive reaction or
vice versa.</p>

<p>"Cases formerly classed as allied to manic-depressive
should be placed here rather than in the undiagnosed
group.</p>

<p>"In the statistical reports the following should be
specified:&mdash;(a) Manic type; (b) Depressive type; (c)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Stuporous type; (d) Mixed type; (e) Circular type; (f)
Other types."</p>

<p>Diefendorf<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> states that manic-depressive insanity
comprises from twelve to twenty per cent of the admissions
to hospitals for mental diseases. He reports defective
heredity as being shown in from seventy to eighty
per cent of the cases. He also found about seventy-five
per cent of the patients suffering from this disease to
be of the female sex. Buckley<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> states that sixty per
cent of the cases give positive histories of "familial neuropathy
and psychopathy." Paton<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> is of the opinion
that heredity is a factor in from eighty to ninety per
cent of all cases. Hoch has called attention to the constitutional
makeup of individuals subject to manic-depressive
attacks and suggests that they are usually of
a moody, morose type, unduly optimistic or temperamentally
unstable. Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> found suicidal tendencies
in 14.7 per cent of the female patients, and in 20.4 per
cent of the men. Nine per cent of his cases showed a
manic makeup; 12.1 per cent, a depressive temperament;
12.4 per cent were irascible or nervous; and from three
to four per cent exhibited cyclothymic tendencies. Of
the cases admitted to his clinic 48.9 per cent were depressive
forms; 16.6 per cent, manic; and 34.5 per cent
represented both types in various combinations. Melancholia
simplex and gravis constituted 23.5 per cent of the
simple forms, 13.5 per cent showed phantastic delusions
and 6.1 per cent anxieties. Hypomanias made up four
per cent, and acute mania, 9.8 per cent of the cases. Confused
and stuporous states constituted 8.2 per cent and
compulsions, one per cent. Lighter forms constituted
ten per cent, and more severe types, nine per cent of the
admissions. Stupors and clouding were found in 4.9
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
per cent and delusional states in 4.9 per cent of the total.
He quotes Walker as reporting, in a study of 674 cases,
that excitements contributed eleven per cent; depressions,
55.7 per cent; and circular forms 33.3 per cent of the male
cases; and excitements, 6.2 per cent; depressions, 70.2
per cent; and circular types, 23.6 per cent of the female
admissions. In from sixty to seventy per cent of Kraepelin's
cases the first attack was a depression. In two-thirds
of them, after the first mild attack there was a
remission. In one-third of the cases, the depression terminated
in an excitement followed by recovery. When
the disease begins with a manic attack, two-thirds of the
cases are followed by a remission. He reports excitements
with a duration of ten years and depressions of
fourteen years standing. In a study of 703 remissions
he found ninety-six lasting from ten to nineteen years;
thirty-four, from twenty to twenty-nine years; eight,
from thirty to thirty-nine years; and one of forty-four
years. He is of the opinion that the length of remission
bears no relation to the duration of the attack. Of
the depressions, 167 had a remission of six years; forty-six
of 2.8 years; and twenty-seven of two years or more.
Of the manic forms, fifty-three had remissions of 3.3
years; twenty-four of 4.5 years; and twenty of two years
or more. Manic-depressive psychoses constitute from
ten to fifteen per cent of the admissions at Kraepelin's
clinic. He found hereditary taint in eighty per cent of
his Heidelberg cases and quotes Walker as reporting
73.4 per cent; Saiz 84.7 per cent; Weygandt, ninety per
cent; and Albrecht, 80.6 per cent. A history of alcoholism
was found in twenty-five per cent and syphilis in eight
per cent of the male patients.</p>

<p>Rehm made an interesting study of the offspring of
manic-depressives. Of forty-four children in nineteen
families, fifty-two per cent showed evidences of psychic
degenerations, twenty-nine per cent of which consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
in an abnormal emotional makeup usually of the depressive
types. In 157 cases from fifty-nine families, Bergamasco
found that 109 showed manic-depressive psychoses.
Kraepelin noted that the highest percentage of
the first attacks occurred between the ages of fifteen and
twenty. Reiss made a very significant analysis of the
various forms of the disease manifested by individuals
possessing definite predisposition. Thus, of the cases
with a depressive makeup 64.2 per cent had depressive
attacks, 8.3 per cent, manic, and 27.5 per cent, combined
forms. Of those with manic temperaments, 35.6 per cent
had depressive attacks, 23.3 per cent, manic, and 41.1
per cent, combined forms. Of the irritable individuals,
45.5 per cent had depressive attacks, 24.4 per cent, manic,
and 30.1 per cent, combined forms. Of the cyclothymic
persons, 35.3 per cent had depressions, 11.7 per cent, excitements,
and fifty-three per cent, combined forms.</p>

<p>An analysis of the number of cases of manic-depressive
insanity admitted to American institutions is exceedingly
interesting in view of the opinions expressed
by Kraepelin. From 1912 to 1919 there were 49,640 first
admissions to the thirteen New York state hospitals. Of
these, 7,499, or 15.1 per cent, were diagnosed as having
manic-depressive psychoses or allied conditions. During
the years 1918 and 1919, when the Association's classification
was officially used throughout, the percentage
of manic-depressive psychoses was 14.57. In the fourteen
state hospitals of Massachusetts in 1919 there were
3,011 first admissions. Two hundred and eighty-three,
or 9.39 per cent, of these were manic-depressive psychoses.
In twenty-one state hospitals in fourteen other
states, practically all in 1917, 1918 and 1919, there were
18,336 first admissions. Of these 3,409, or 18.59 per cent,
were cases of manic-depressive insanity. Thus, of the
70,987 first admissions reported from forty-eight hospitals
in sixteen different states there were 11,191 cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of manic-depressive insanity, a percentage of 15.76. This
may probably be looked upon as fairly representative of
the incidence of manic-depressive psychoses in American
institutions.</p>

<p class="p2b">When it comes to an analysis of the various forms of
manic-depressive psychoses reported, the indications are
not so clear. In New York during 1918 and 1919 there
were 1,980 cases distributed as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p10">It will be noted that manic cases are more common than
the depressive in New York, the number of the former
being fifteen per cent greater than the latter. In Massachusetts
the number of depressive forms is twenty-two
per cent higher than the manic. In the other states the
depressive types are less than five per cent higher than
the manic. In all institutions the mixed forms are more
common than the circular or stuporous. The stuporous
forms constitute the smallest percentage reported in all
hospitals, except in 1918 and 1919 in New York. We
would be warranted, apparently, in the conclusion that
in this country manic forms are the more common, the
depressive being second in frequency, followed by the
circular and stuporous types in the order mentioned.</p>

<p>The statement is, I think, also warranted that there
is a considerable difference of opinion as to the classification
of the different forms of manic-depressive insanity
and that diagnostic procedure is far from being standardized.
Many of these discrepancies are doubtless due to
difficulties in differentiating between certain cases of
manic-depressive psychoses and dementia praecox. The
hospitals reporting lower percentages of the former usually
show a much higher rate of the latter. Certainly
there is room for an honest difference of opinion in many
instances. It must be admitted, moreover, that our fundamental
conceptions of these two great groups do not
permit of a hard and fast line of demarcation between
them in all cases.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br /><br />

<span class="st">INVOLUTION MELANCHOLIA</span></h3>
</div>

<p>In 1896 Kraepelin first definitely outlined his views
on dementia praecox, to which he assigned hebephrenia,
although he did not at the time include katatonia in his
delimitation of that disease. He also described melancholia
in his fifth edition, classifying it as an involutional
or retrograde presenile process (Das Irresein des Rückbildungsalters).
He had not as yet formulated his theory
of the manic-depressive psychoses although he described
manic and depressive forms of periodical constitutional
disorders. In 1899 he discarded the mania and melancholia
of other writers altogether or rather included them
in his new manic-depressive group, but still retained
melancholia as a distinct entity occurring in the involutional
period of life only. As has already been shown,
melancholia is a term which had been used for centuries
and in a general way applied to depressions of any and
all types. Kraepelin's manic-depressive psychoses and
dementia praecox very largely destroyed the integrity
of this old-time conception. It has been shown, furthermore,
that depressive states often constitute an integral
part of the picture of general paresis. Symptomatic depressions
more or less distinct in character have been
associated with a number of somatic diseases. Senile
psychoses, epilepsy, various organic conditions, the psychoneuroses
and the psychopathic personalities have depressive
manifestations well recognized and readily
classifiable.</p>

<p>Kraepelin, however, pointed out the fact that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
was another group still unaccounted for&mdash;the anxious
depressions of later life, which he included under the designation
of involution melancholia and which did not
belong to the manic-depressive group. This he described
as being preeminently a depression associated almost
always with anxiety and fear as prominent symptoms.
Accompanying this condition there are usually ideas
of poverty, sin, or impending danger of some kind. Delusions
of self-accusation are quite common. Anxious
restlessness or agitated excitement is to be expected in
a majority of the cases. There is usually no clouding
of the consciousness, although, as Hoch expresses it,
"the mental horizon may be more or less narrowed to
the depressive ideas." The memory as a rule is not
impaired. Hallucinations of sight and hearing are often
present. Somatic delusions of a hypochondriacal nature
occur. Insomnia is usually marked. The tendency of the
disease is towards deterioration. Retardation and psychomotor
inactivity are not to be expected. Melancholia
is to be differentiated from manic-depressive insanity by
the prominence of anxiety and apprehension, the absence
of any retardation or psychomotor inhibition, the unusual
frequency of self-accusation with ideas of sinfulness, the
clearness of the sensorium, the comparatively unfavorable
prognosis and the great frequency of suicidal impulses.
The age, and the absence of previous attacks, is,
of course, exceedingly important in arriving at a diagnosis.
The onset of the disease is usually between the
ages of forty and sixty, but not infrequently it begins
with the menopause in women, and Kraepelin states that
sixty per cent of the cases occur in the female sex. He
found a history of defective heredity very common. The
precipitating factor is often some mental shock, the illness
or death of friends, or disasters of various kinds.
No distinctive pathology of the disease has been described
by Kraepelin. He was uncertain as to the rôle played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
by arteriosclerosis in its etiology. Diefendorf<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> reported
that about one-third of the cases made complete
recoveries; twenty-three per cent were able to return to
their previous surroundings; twenty-six per cent terminated
in an advanced state of deterioration and nineteen
per cent died within a period of two or three years.</p>

<p>In 1907 Dreyfus,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> at that time an assistant of
Kraepelin's, made an elaborate study of the cases previously
diagnosed as involution melancholia in the Heidelberg
clinic. During a period of fourteen years, a total
of seventy-nine were reported. A thorough investigation
by Dreyfus showed that two-thirds of these had made
complete recoveries or improved to such an extent as
to be able to go home. Only eight per cent showed a
marked mental deterioration. He also found that over
half of the series had more than one attack, usually depressions.
One-third of the patients died and were thus
eliminated from further consideration. The duration of
the attack was over three years in one-third of the cases
reviewed. Fifteen per cent recovered in from three to
five years, nine per cent in from six to eight years, and
eight per cent in from ten to fourteen years. He was of
the opinion that after a careful study of the hospital
records the symptoms found could all be explained on the
basis of manic-depressive insanity, usually of a mixed
form. Kraepelin had reported that forty-nine per cent
of his cases deteriorated mentally. Dreyfus reduced this
on further observation to only eight per cent. On analysis
he found, in many instances, brief periods of manic
elation, sometimes only a matter of hours or a few days,
evidences of excitability, manic suggestion in the eagerness
of the patient to communicate his troubles to others,
and inhibitory processes indicated by a lack of interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
loss of affection or even difficulty of thinking. Dreyfus
concluded that the depressions of late years were not so
common as had been supposed and that a sufficient knowledge
of their history showed that they had usually exhibited
previous attacks. He thought that the long duration
of the disease probably led to erroneous ideas as
to its termination in deterioration.</p>

<p>Kirby<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> is of the opinion that Dreyfus based some
of his findings on insufficient evidence, as shown by his
published case records:&mdash;"In a considerable number of
other cases the author's conclusion that manic-depressive
symptoms were present is based on extremely
meagre data. As an illustration one case may be referred
to briefly. A man fifty-three years old had an
agitated depression lasting over two and one-half years
and terminating in recovery. The case record contains
no statement of any objective inhibition or feeling of
subjective insufficiency, neither are there any statements
regarding flight of ideas, or unusual loquacity. The diagnosis,
however, is made of manic-depressive insanity, with
partial psychomotor inhibition and flight of ideas. The
assumption that these symptoms existed is based entirely
on the retrospective account from the patient, obtained
three years after recovery from the psychosis. He then
declared that during the attack he could not think calmly;
it seemed that one thought "knocked the other down,"
one thought "hunted after the other." He also described
a feeling as if there were a cap on his head, as if he were
nailed down. These retrospective statements are interpreted
to mean that there was partial psychomotor inhibition
and flight of ideas. In many other cases the
reasoning is just as forced and the deductions based on
equally insufficient grounds.... The author's aim was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
to see if the symptoms present fitted into certain schematic
formula and thus the analysis became rather a search
for diagnostic signs supposed to characterize a definite
form of disease. Such a method leads away from consideration
of the mental disorder as a whole; a few minor
features are emphasized in the picture and because the
patient recovers these are raised to diagnostic importance&mdash;a
little feeling of insufficiency or a slight change
of mood in a disorder which ends in recovery are seized
upon as evidence that a special kind of disease exists;
as a matter of fact, we would hardly miss just such symptoms
in many other psychoses. There is no attempt to
get below the surface, to understand the evolution of the
disorder, or to use the facts in the development in formulating
the prognosis."</p>

<p>In the introduction to the book written by Dreyfus in
1907, Kraepelin nevertheless expressed the opinion that
"These results show that for the most of these disorders
which have been designated as melancholia there now
exists no sufficient reason to separate them from manic-depressive
insanity." This at the time was looked upon
as definitely settling the fate of the melancholia concept
and it was abandoned by some. As a general rule, however,
the psychiatrists of this country seem to have accepted
Kraepelin's original description of the disease
as being thoroughly justified. To use White's words,
"Many psychiatrists still believe, although Kraepelin
himself accepts Dreyfus' conclusions, that there is still
a place for involution melancholia distinct from the
manic-depressive group."</p>

<p>In his eighth edition Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> discusses melancholia
as a presenile condition and reviews the whole
situation in considerable detail. He shows that symptomatic
considerations alone did not guide him in his
original conception of the disease. A great deal of weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
was attached to prognosis and certain forms were separated
out and differentiated from manic-depressive because
they tended towards mental enfeeblement. He calls
attention to the fact that Thalbitzer disputed the integrity
of melancholia in 1905, classifying it as a manic-depressive
reaction. After reviewing the findings of Dreyfus
he admits that the conclusions of the latter are in
the main correct and that involution melancholia as
originally described cannot be retained as a definite entity.
"The significant fact still remains," he says, "that
single attacks of depression are disproportionately common
in the involution period." Hübner, for instance,
found twenty-one single attacks of melancholia after the
fiftieth year of age to only two single attacks of mania.
"The appearance of depressions, therefore, through the
revolutions of this period of life seems to be favored
to a special degree." He again states that he is unable
to determine what rôle is played in the involutional
depressions by beginning arteriosclerosis or the onset of
senile conditions. He concludes, however, that a form
of depression, earlier described as melancholia, is still
to be separated from the manic-depressive psychoses
although not entirely clear as to its significance or exact
delimitation.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>These are the most severe and rapidly fatal forms of
anxious excitements, as a rule developing suddenly and
included now in his presenile group. "These cases are
anxious, restless, sleepless, self-accusatory and show delusions
of persecution." The delusional ideas are depressive,
extravagant and hypochondriacal. "They have
offended everybody; are eternally damned; Satan is
coming and will take them; he is out there. Nature has
changed, everything is different, no mercy can come from
heaven; there are ghosts in the house; the patients find
themselves in the infernal regions, are surrounded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
hostile powers, are in a bewitched castle. They will be
carried away, thrown into a fiery furnace, their arms
and legs cut off, have their throats cut in the presence
of a thousand students, and be buried alive. They have
a cancer in the stomach, the husband is insane or has had
a stroke." Suicidal attempts are frequent. Sometimes
grandiose ideas are expressed, accompanied by hallucinations.
Apprehension and orientation are usually not
disturbed. This is ordinarily followed by a period of
violent excitement with agitated wringing of the hands,
striking the breast, tearing the hair, etc. Confusional
conditions with clouding may appear, often terminating
shortly in a pneumonia, erysipelas or heart failure. According
to Nissl, widespread and well marked changes are
to be found in the brain at autopsy. There is an extensive
destruction of ganglion cells, although that cannot
be definitely associated with the symptoms of the disease.
Kraepelin leaves the question open as to whether
this should be looked upon as some form of "acute delirium"
such as manifests itself in the course of various
psychoses. The disease is usually one of the sixth decade
of life, much more common in the female sex, and cannot
without further information be definitely excluded
from the involutional processes. He concludes his discussion
by saying that these conditions probably "have
some relation to the similar delirious senile forms to be
discussed later." This is, of course, a decided modification
of his original views, although it is quite clear that he
still feels that there is an involutional depression, now
included, however, in the presenile group.</p>

<p>In his chapter on manic-depressive insanity three
years later Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> referred to this question again
as follows:&mdash;"Under these circumstances I thought at
first that the involutional depressions described as special
clinical forms, melancholia in the narrower sense,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
which seemed to show essential differences in its general
characteristics, course, and to a certain extent in the
history of its development, should be separated from
manic-depressive insanity. At the same time I was aware
of the fact that in a considerable number of the involutional
depressions, both on account of their clinical form
and their association sooner or later with manic states,
their connection with manic-depressive insanity could not
be questioned. I therefore made an effort to establish a
practical differentiation, entirely without satisfactory results.
Further experience has demonstrated, as was
shown in the discussion of the presenile psychoses, that
they do not constitute grounds for the separation of
melancholia. Deterioration is explained by the development
of senile or arteriosclerotic changes. Some cases
were of long duration, showing manic symptoms before
recovery. The frequency of depressions in advanced
years we have learned to be a legitimate development of
the involutional period of life. The substitution of anxious
excitement for volitional inhibition has proved to
be an occurrence which is found in advancing years in
those cases which had an attack of the ordinary form in
the decade before (as shown in our cases 1 and 2). Hübner
has, moreover, made the observation that melancholia
may show retardation in one attack and not in the next.
There remains, therefore, no adequate reason for differentiating
the involutional depressions heretofore described
as melancholia from manic-depressive insanity."</p>

<p>Kehrer<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> has made a careful analysis of the facts
brought out by Kraepelin's statistical diagram showing
the various age groups represented by his manic-depressive
cases. "From the fifteenth year of life, at
which age manic and melancholic attacks are most frequent
(about twenty-five per cent), the curve of the manic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
attacks falls steadily (with only two important rises at
the thirty-fifth and the forty-fifth years) until it becomes
less than five per cent at the seventieth year, while the
curve of the melancholic conditions with equal constancy
increases (with the exception of the fifty-fifth year only),
especially between the forty-fifth and fiftieth years, from
fifty-two to seventy-four per cent and finally to eighty
per cent. On the other hand, the curve of the manic first
attacks falls steadily from 28.5 per cent at the twentieth
year to 3.5 per cent at the sixtieth, with a slight increase
at fifty from 12.7 per cent to 13.4 per cent, while in the
male sex the same curve shows no further increase after
the thirtieth year, when it reaches its maximum (33.8 per
cent) and even shows a particularly sharp fall, from
22.2 per cent to 5.9 per cent, between the fiftieth and sixtieth
year.... Based on this diagram Kraepelin concluded
that the depressions of the involutional period,
which did not show special symptoms of some other disease
entity, could not be differentiated from those of the
earlier periods of life."</p>

<p>Specht,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Hübner and Stransky have subscribed to
these views. Stransky expressed the opinion that "there
is nothing in the form of these depressions, either with or
without anxiety, by which they can be distinguished from
those recognized as manic-depressive insanity and that
neither the course nor the age of onset offer any convincing
argument for their clinical independence." Rehm, on
the other hand, held that there were depressions of the
involutional period of life corresponding to Kraepelin's
melancholia and not belonging to manic-depressive insanity.
He described these as lacking the constitutional
taint and characterized by a slow onset, without previous
attacks, fatigability, outspoken egocentric conduct, hypochondriacal
delusions of the deteriorative type and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
appearance of hallucinations. Bleuler,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Bumke, Seelert,
Albrecht and others still hold to the integrity of involution
melancholia as a distinct entity. "These forms,"
as Bleuler expresses it, "have as a rule a much more
protracted course. They progress slowly for one or two
years, continue to be mild, reaching their height in several
years, and decline slowly to their final conclusion.
The inhibition is obscured by great restlessness, genuine
agitated forms are common, they tend to recidivism much
less than the others and show also much less heredity."
Albrecht, in 138 cases of functional psychoses of the
involutional period, only thirty-two of which were in
men, diagnosed eighty-two as genuine involution melancholia.
In none of his cases did he find an isolated attack
of mania in that period of life. He differentiates this
condition from agitated melancholia, leaving the question
open as to whether this constitutes a pernicious form
or is a presenile disease. According to Bumke, psychic
causes are more prominent in involution melancholia than
in the manic-depressive psychoses, the duration is longer
and they do not make such complete recoveries, the most
common termination being a depressive mental enfeeblement,
with despondency and an anxious hypochondriacal
mood. For the genetic interpretation of climacteric
melancholia as well as the other involutional forms the
intimate association, according to Bumke, of endogenous
with exogenous factors is the point of greatest importance.
"Involution only brings the barrel to an overflow; it
only adds exogenous to the individual endogenous momentum
so that the sum total leads to the outbreak of a
manifest psychosis." Seelert goes still further with the
endogenous exogenous theory of Bumke. "It depends
on the type of the association whether the organic anxiety
psychosis, a melancholia or the depression of a manic-depressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
insanity develops in the later period of life.
In one the endogenous factors predominate, in the other
the exogenous and in melancholia (in its narrower sense)
the two maintain a balance."</p>

<p>Although, as has been noted, no characteristic pathological
changes have been associated with involutional
melancholia, a condition to which attention was called
by Adolf Meyer should be referred to here. In 1901,
in an article in "Brain" on "The Parenchymatous Systemic
Degenerations mainly in the Central Nervous System"
he proposed the name "Central Neuritis" for a
terminal affection previously described by Turner in 1899
and occurring more frequently perhaps in involutional
melancholia than in any other psychosis:&mdash;"This alteration
has been found to occur in peculiar forms of end
stages of depressive disorders, near or after the climacteric
period, alcoholic-senile and alcoholico-phthisical
cachectic states, idiocy, and perhaps also general paralysis
(Turner's case). Ordinary infectious and cachectic
states do not, however, appear to form an important link
in the causes."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The mental condition is usually
anxious, agitated and apprehensive, often terminating in
a delirium followed by a stupor. The disease may last
for a few days ending in death or may recover after
several weeks. It is accompanied by progressive
weakness, loss of weight and wasting, a slight rise of
temperature, and in many cases attacks of diarrhea.
Characteristic are muscular tension with rigidity, twitching
movements, incoordination and jactitation of the
limbs. The reflexes are usually increased. The onset
is often quite sudden, usually in the fourth, fifth or sixth
decade of life. At autopsy a striking condition, described
as axonal alteration, is found in the "Betz" and other
large ganglion cells generally. The cell body is somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
swollen, the stainable substance is reduced to a
structureless powder and the nucleus is dislocated and
appears conspicuously in the periphery. There is also
some "Marchi" degeneration of the fibre tracts in the
motor areas. The regions involved, according to Meyer,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
are "the cortico-thalmic connections of the motor areas,
the auditory radiation, the forceps, the pyramids, the
fillet, the restiform body, and to a lesser degree, the
posterior column of the cord, the intersegmental elements,
and the segmental efferent motor elements."</p>

<p>In view of the attitude of the psychiatrists of this
country as shown by numerous expressions of opinion,
the statistical committee of the Association felt justified
in retaining involution melancholia in its classification of
psychoses for the present and collecting data for further
consideration. The following suggestions were offered
as to its delimitation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These depressions are probably related to the manic-depressive
group; nevertheless the symptoms and the
course of the involution cases are sufficiently characteristic
to justify us in keeping them apart as special forms
of emotional reaction.</p>

<p>"To be included here are the slowly developing depressions
of <em>middle life and later years</em> which come on
with worry, insomnia, uneasiness, anxiety and agitation,
showing usually the unreality and sensory complex, but
little or no evidence of any difficulty in thinking. The
tendency is for the course to be a prolonged one. Arteriosclerotic
depressions should be excluded.</p>

<p>"When agitated depressions of the involution period
are clearly superimposed on a manic-depressive foundation
with previous attacks (depression or excitement)
they should for statistical purposes be classed in the
manic-depressive group."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>
<p>In view of the history of the development of the conception
of this psychosis an analysis of the hospital statistics
on this subject is of unusual interest. We now have
reports of over seventy thousand first admissions based
almost entirely on the classification at present used by
the Association. In 49,640 first admissions to the New
York hospitals during a period of eight years there were
1,351 cases diagnosed as involution melancholia&mdash;2.72 per
cent of the total. During 1918 and 1919, when the Association's
classification was followed in detail, these hospitals
showed 480 cases, or 3.45 per cent of 13,588 first
admissions. Twenty-one public institutions in fourteen
other states reported 378 cases, or 2.06 per cent of 18,336
admissions. Two and twenty-five hundredths per cent of
the admissions to the Massachusetts state hospitals in
1919 were cases of involution melancholia. Reports from
forty-eight different state hospitals show that involution
melancholia constituted 2.53 per cent of over seventy
thousand admissions. This shows a remarkable similarity
in standards of diagnosis as far as this psychosis is
concerned.</p>

<span class="st">DEMENTIA PRAECOX</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The dementia praecox of today, notwithstanding the
numerous theories which have been advanced as to its
etiology and pathology and the various fundamental conceptions
which have been evolved in the interpretation of
its mental mechanisms, is essentially the disease described
by Kraepelin in 1899. The designation which he
applied to this psychosis or group of psychoses was not
new, having been used by Morel as early as 1860 and
again by Pick in 1891. His views as to the delimitation
of the disease were, however, altogether different from
those of earlier writers and were destined to inaugurate
a new era in psychiatry. The grouping which he proposed
would include certain types of mania and melancholia
and the psychoses of puberty and adolescence
described by Hecker and Kahlbaum together with various
paranoid states previously associated with paranoia,
chronic delusional insanity, etc.</p>

<p>Kraepelin thus at one blow destroyed the integrity of
mania, melancholia, terminal dementia and paranoia, entities
which had been practically unquestioned for centuries.
This radical departure from established psychiatric
procedure was based on his observation that
various definite characteristics were common to certain
cases in all of these clinical groups and that they were of
vital significance from a symptomatic as well as a prognostic
point of view. He called attention to the fact that
excitements and depressions often recurred or alternated
in the same individual without any tendency towards
mental enfeeblement. An analysis of the mental mechanisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
and symptomatology of these cases led to his well-known
conception of the manic-depressive psychoses.
Other clinical groups equally well-defined, although not
so sharply circumscribed, showed consistent and progressive
tendencies towards mental deterioration. These
were brought together and described as dementia praecox.
This may be looked upon as a logical development
of the progress made by the German school of psychiatrists.
The first step in this direction perhaps was the
recognition of hebephrenia by Hecker in 1871. He particularly
emphasized the occurrence of this condition at
the time of puberty or during the adolescent period.
This has often been referred to as "silly dementia." The
preliminary stage or onset in many instances was characterized
by a gradual change in personality. This was evidenced
by foolish behavior, silly actions and a failure of
adjustment to the patient's surroundings often resulting
in an abandonment of his usual occupation, with an evident
gradual intellectual deterioration. Initial attacks
of depression were frequent, usually with hypochondriacal
ideas and only occasional hallucinations or delusions.
Transitory periods of excitement were common sequelae.
The emotional reactions were characterized by their shallowness,
the train of thought by incoherence, the conduct
by foolish and senseless acts and the intellectual reactions
by an advancing deterioration. "The weakminded silliness
of the disease picture," in the words of Krafft-Ebing,
"is partly to be explained by the original weakmindedness
of the patient, which Hecker emphasizes in
the etiology of his cases."</p>

<p>A more decided step in the development of the dementia
praecox concept was the description by Kahlbaum
of katatonia in 1874. This may be ushered in by an
early stage strongly suggesting hebephrenia but terminating
usually in a depression followed by states of
excitement, stupor and dementia. The characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
features of the disease are the peculiar catatonic stupor
so-called, and forms of excitement differing materially
from those exhibited in the manic-depressive psychoses.
Hallucinations and delusions are almost invariably present.
The delusions are likely to be of a most absurd and
extravagant type, accompanied by self-accusation in some
instances but oftener by feelings of influence referred to
others or somatic ideas. States of muscular tension appear
early, with constrained attitudes and peculiar mannerisms.
The stupor which is such a prominent feature
in the picture is characterized by negativism shown by a
resistance to all external influences, mutism and a refusal
to accept food. This may be associated with rigidity
due to extreme muscular tension which is often so marked
as to be described as cataleptic. Automatism may manifest
itself in the form of echolalia or echopraxia. The
excitements are characterized by impulsive acts of violence.
Verbigeration and stereotypy are frequent symptoms.
Remissions are rather to be expected but the
tendency of the disease is towards a marked mental
deterioration in the great majority of cases.</p>

<p>Schüle in 1886 suggested the term dementia praecox
as one applicable to the psychoses of adolescence. It remained
for Kraepelin, however, to establish the entity of
these disease processes by including still another type,
the paranoid forms, which were left entirely unaccounted
for in the conceptions of Hecker, Kahlbaum, Schüle,
Morel, Pick, or any of the earlier writers. In this group
he included cases with persistent hallucinations, more
or less loosely systematized delusions of persecution and
gradually increasing deterioration but with little or no
clouding of consciousness.</p>

<p>In the last edition of his book Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> defines
dementia praecox as including "a group of clinical pictures
having the common symptom of a characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
destruction of the internal associations of the psychic
personality affecting particularly the emotional and volitional
spheres".... "Although wide differences of
opinion still exist on many points, the conviction seems
to be gaining ground more and more that dementia praecox
on the whole represents a well-defined disease entity,
and that we are justified in regarding the majority at
least of the apparently dissimilar clinical types here described
as the manifestations of a single disease process."
Many objections have been raised to the name applied to
this psychosis by Kraepelin. It has been pointed out
that complete deterioration is not always the termination
to be expected in this group and that it is not always a
disease of adolescence. All of this was conceded by
Kraepelin. He employed the term as one answering the
purpose "until a more thorough understanding would
suggest an appropriate designation." His conception of
the psychosis as described in the sixth edition of his
book may, I think, be said to have received the rather
general approval of the psychiatric world. While there
has been no serious attack on his delimitation of the disease
entity itself, there has been a decided controversy
as to the psychological mechanisms involved and the
fundamental principles upon which his conceptions were
based. Certainly no textbook of recent years has failed
to give a very serious consideration to the question of
dementia praecox.</p>

<p>Stransky (1909) looked upon dementia praecox as the
result of a lack of coordination of the intellect, the emotions
and volition, which he expresses as an intrapsychic
ataxia. This is illustrated by the displacement of the
affect so common in dementia praecox and its association
with an entirely incongruous idea. Thus, the patient
laughs while expressing an exceedingly depressing delusional
belief or cries while telling a joke. No emotion
is displayed at the statement that he is being buried alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
or torn apart by some outside agency. This would possibly
explain the unprovoked rages of the catatonic and the
discrepancy between the catalepsy and mutism of a patient
who is found to be perfectly oriented as to his surroundings
and the curious fact that he is often thoroughly
clear as to the exact day and date.</p>

<p>Wernicke's theories regarding the elaboration of mental
mechanisms have already been referred to. He saw
in dementia praecox and other deteriorative processes
the possibility of a dissociation of psychical reflexes due
to an interruption or disturbance located in the psychomotor
projection field, preventing its proper coordination
with the intrapsychic elaboration mechanisms.</p>

<p>The psychological processes involved in schizophrenia
as outlined by Bleuler<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> (1911) have a very important
bearing on the interpretation of the symptoms of dementia
praecox. The group which he described under this
designation is a very broad one, including "many atypical
melancholias and manias of other schools (as well as
hysterical melancholias and manias), the most of the
hallucinatory confusions, many of the amentias described
by others (our conception of amentia is much narrower),
some of the forms belonging to acute delirium,
Wernicke's motility psychoses, primary and secondary
dementias without special designations, the most of the
paranoias of other schools, especially the hysterical
paranoias and almost all of the incurable hypochondrias,
nervousness, compulsions and impulsions." To these he
adds the various "juvenile and masturbation forms," a
large part of the degenerative psychoses of Magnan,
many prison psychoses and the Ganser symptom complex.
In view of the fact, as Bleuler<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> expresses it, that
"The name dementia praecox, which neither leads to
dementia nor is precocious in its origin, necessarily, gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
rise to many misunderstandings," he suggested the designation
schizophrenia as more appropriate. "Even if we
cannot make a natural grouping, it would appear that
schizophrenia is not a disease in the narrower sense but
a group of diseases somewhat analogous to the organic
group, which includes paralysis, the senile forms, etc.
Schizophrenia should therefore be spoken of really in
the plural. The disease pursues a chronic course or
progresses in attacks and may come to a standstill at any
stage or may even regress but never to a complete restitutio
ad integrum. It is characterized by a specific type
of alteration in thinking, feeling and relation to the outer
world encountered nowhere else. Accessory symptoms
of a characteristic type are particularly common....
Dementia praecox in any stage may come to a stop, and
many of its symptoms partially or entirely disappear
but when it progresses further it leads to dementia and
dementia of a definite type." A fundamental symptom,
according to Bleuler, is the disturbance of association of
ideas. "The normal association of ideas loses its stability;
others enter at will and take their place. Thus the
ideas lose their relation to each other and thought becomes
incoherent." As Hoch<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> says of this disturbance,
"Bleuler described it very extensively, and yet
somehow it is not so very easy to grasp the nature of
this disorder; it is evidently not so very different from
Wernicke's sejunction, though free from all localizing
anatomical bywork. It is conceived of as a more or less
widespread primary interruption of the associative connection
of ideas. Actual or latent associations, which,
in the normal, determine the train of thought or
combinations of such ideas may remain without influence
upon it in an apparently aimless fashion, whereas other
ideas which have no connection may intrude themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
Hence the train of thought is scattered, bizarre, illogical,
abrupt. This may be so slight that it is difficult to discover,
and in his description of mild conditions he says
it may not be found, or only after a thorough search; it
accounts for much of the scattering of ideas in chronic
states, and, as we have said, it is supposed to be the explanatory
principle in acute incoherence. On the other
hand, similar phenomena may be due to the action of
complexes, and have to be explained psychogenically.
But the psychogenic explanation does not appear to him
sufficient. It is somewhat difficult to see, especially when
we consider the extensive symbolization and substitution,
the indifference, the negativism, etc., why something beyond
these psychogenically explicable disorders is required."
An essential feature of Bleuler's<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> concept
is "autismus." "The schizophrenics lose their contact
with reality, the mild cases inconspicuously here and
there, the severe cases, completely".... "When we
allow our fancies free reign in mythology, in dreams and
in many of the morbid states, thought will not or cannot
concern itself with realities; it follows the dictates of
instincts and emotions. This disregarding of the inconsistency
with reality is characteristic of autistic thinking."</p>

<p>In his excellent review of Bleuler's schizophrenia already
referred to, Hoch<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> makes the following comments
on this subject:&mdash;"A difficult subject is autism. By
autism Bleuler means that which we have called the shut
in tendency, the more or less complete shutting out of the
environment, or at any rate, all that which does not correspond
to the wishes. It may be so marked that the
patients even shut out all sensory impressions, close their
eyes and ears, make their body as small as possible by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
crouching. Bleuler regards this autism as a secondary
phenomenon, and looks upon it as one of the results of
his association disorder, whereas the autistic thinking is
the day-dreaming, the thinking without reference to
reality. This autistic thinking flourishes in schizophrenia&mdash;Bleuler
thinks that the schizophrenic defect in logic
makes the exclusion of a great many external and internal
facts possible, and thus gives sway to a tendency which
we all have, namely, to live in fancies which suit us,
something which we indulge in but do not allow to influence
our conduct, but which in the schizophrenic assumes
the value of reality." An outline of Bleuler's views
would not be complete without his definition of blocking,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
an important symptom. "Blocking is a sudden
emotional inhibition of the psychic processes and in itself
not pathological." He found it in normal individuals
in nervousness and in hysteria. "Where it is
not based on adequate psychological grounds, is generalized
or of long duration, its presence warrants the diagnosis
of schizophrenia."</p>

<p>A study of the psychogenic factors concerned in
dementia praecox led Meyer<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> to the conclusion that the
psychological processes of the disease were due to abnormal
mental mechanisms developing in individuals
unable to adjust themselves to their surroundings. "The
general principle is that many individuals cannot afford
to count on unlimited elasticity in the habitual use of
certain habits of adjustment, that instincts will be
undermined by persistent misapplication, and the delicate
balance of mental adjustment and of its material
substratum must largely depend on a maintenance of
sound instinct and reaction type." This theory is supported
somewhat by the "shut in personality" found by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
Hoch<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> in his studies of the history of a large number
of cases developing dementia praecox.</p>

<p>Elaborate analyses of the psychological mechanisms
involved in dementia praecox have been made by Jung
and others. Freud believed hysteria to be the result of
a psychic trauma. The unpleasant idea associated with
this trauma is repressed into the subconscious because the
individual is unable to react to it in a normal way and it
is forgotten, but not until it is compensated for by a
hysterical symbol or symptom which takes its place. By
means of psychoanalysis, the association test and the
study of dreams the nature of the psychic trauma can
often be determined. Jung<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> adapted these methods
of study to a consideration of dementia praecox. His
investigations showed that many of the seemingly meaningless
manifestations of that disease are symbols or
substitutes for buried complexes. In some instances
these remain in their original form without transformation.
Complexes associated with a feeling of deficiency
and injured pride may lead to suspicion and delusions of
persecution. Unfulfilled longings may be actualized in a
delirium or delusion of grandeur. Symbols and substitutes
generally are said to represent complexes which
are antagonistic to the ego and are therefore transformed
and become unrecognizable. The peculiar symptoms of
dementia praecox as a rule are a result of the individual's
inability to make compensatory readjustments. In
the paranoid forms the patient entirely reconstructs his
psychical life. White<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> attempts to explain the meaning
of some of these delusional formations in his "Outlines
of Psychiatry":&mdash;"The relation of the delusion to the
complex is often obvious if one is familiar with the more
important of the infantile material. A man believes himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
pregnant, that a child is in his stomach. This is
obviously a regression to the period when as an infant
he had not understood that gestation was a particular
function of the female. Another patient enucleated his
eye (castration symbol); a colored man of about forty
years of age invented a perpetual motion machine (compensation
for impotence); a man tries to invent the
greatest cannon on earth (compensation for small penis
complex); a homosexual man of the "sissy" type made
wild claims of physical prowess, fighting ability, and incessantly
swore and used vulgar language to demonstrate
his toughness (over-compensation of homosexuality); a
woman complains that her sister's husband follows her
through underground passageways and shoots electricity
into her genitalia and anus (anal erotism); an oral erotic
woman starves herself in order to be tube fed; oral
erotic patients often cut their throats while under the
erotic pressure; patients frequently say that God talks
with them or go to Washington to see the President
(father complex); in severe grades of introversion they
sit in a dark corner, head on breast, arms folded and legs
and thighs flexed (intra-uterine position); a young
woman says her real parents are the King and Queen of
Norway (Œdipus phantasy); etc. Of course much of
the delusional material is not so obviously related to
infantile material and must be worked out at length with
the individual to determine its meaning. It must not be
forgotten that a praecox may have, however, complex
reactions exactly like that of hysteria and the psychoneuroses.
To that extent such a patient is hysterical or
psychoneurotic."</p>

<p>The appearance of the last edition of his textbook
showed that Kraepelin has somewhat revised his views
on the subject of dementia praecox. He now speaks of a
series of morbid pictures "brought together under the
designation endogenous dementias for the purpose of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
preliminary understanding." This embraces not only dementia
praecox but a new entity described as "paraphrenia."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
This includes forms "which, contrary to
the usual manifestations of dementia praecox, are characterized
throughout their entire course by the marked
prominence of a characteristic intellectual disturbance
while an independent impairment of volition and particularly
an emotional alteration are lacking or only present
in a mild form. For this differentiation it seems to me
that no more suitable expression than "paraphrenia"
could be employed for the designation of the disease
processes experimentally brought together here." He
speaks of the following types:&mdash;systematica, expansiva,
confabulans and phantastica.</p>

<p>The clinical forms of dementia praecox shown in his
last edition are as follows:&mdash;dementia simplex, hebephrenia,
simple depressive or stuporous dementia, depressive
delusional dementia, circular, agitated and
periodic forms, katatonia, paranoid types (dementia
paranoides gravis and mitis, hallucinatory and paranoid
feeblemindedness) and confusional speech or schizophasia.</p>

<p>His views as to the delimitation of these different
types should be expressed perhaps in his own words:<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306">
</a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>"Simple progressive deterioration as described by
Diem under the designation of 'Dementia Simplex,' consists
in an imperceptible and complete impoverishment
and breaking down of the entire mental life."</p>

<p>Of hebephrenia or silly dementia he says, "In this
disease picture there stands out particularly with the
progressive deterioration of the mental life, an incoherence
of thought, feeling, and conduct."</p>

<p>"As the third group of dementia praecox I should like
to group together, under the designation of simple depressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
or stuporous dementia, those cases in which,
after an initial depression, with or without the appearance
of stupor, a terminal mental deterioration gradually
develops."</p>

<p>"Those cases which progress to the marked development
of phantastic delusions we group together in the
fourth form of dementia praecox&mdash;depressive delusional
dementia."</p>

<p>"The next large group includes those cases in which
severe and protracted excitements develop."</p>

<p>"The first sub group which on account of its course
we may designate as the circular form shows the nearest
relationship to the disease picture just described in that
it also begins with a depression and usually manifests
active delusions."</p>

<p>"As a second sub group, the agitated form, we bring
together those cases in which the disease begins with an
excitement and then immediately or after more or less
frequent remissions and relapse passes into the terminal
stage."</p>

<p>"In close relation to the cases brought together here
we have to consider a small group which either in the
initial stages of the disease or throughout its entire
duration follows an outspoken periodic course; these
amount to less than 2 per cent of all cases."</p>

<p>"The excitements of dementia praecox constitute an
important part of the clinical form&mdash;Katatonia&mdash;which
we must now consider. Under this designation Kahlbaum
described a disease picture which in turn presents
the symptoms of melancholia, mania and stupor, the unfavorable
cases being accompanied by confusion and
deterioration and is furthermore characterized by the
appearance of certain motor seizures and inhibitions&mdash;in
other words, the catatonic disorders."</p>

<p>"In many respects a dissimilar picture is shown by
those cases in which the essential symptoms are delusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
and hallucinations; these we characterize as paranoid
forms. The justification for including them with dementia
praecox I get from the fact that in them sooner or
later the delusion formation is invariably associated
with a series of disturbances which we find everywhere
in the other forms of dementia praecox."</p>

<p>Cases "which do begin with a simple delusion formation
but which in the further course exhibit still more
clearly the peculiar destruction of the mental life and
particularly the emotional and volitional disturbances
which characterize dementia praecox may be grouped together
under the name 'dementia paranoides gravis'."</p>

<p>"As a fourth form of paranoid dementia praecox, I
believe still another group should be added, those which
on the one hand show a similar development and the same
delusion formation as the paranoid disorders just described
but which on the other hand terminate in a characteristic
mental enfeeblement." These he would call
'dementia paranoides mitis'."</p>

<p>"A last very characteristic group of cases the discussion
of which must be included here, is formed by the
patients with confusional speech." These are the Schizophasias
of Bleuler.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that in view of Kraepelin's former
contributions on this subject this classification must be
looked upon as somewhat involved and confusing. It
suggests an unnecessary complication of an already difficult
subject to no great advantage. These varying conceptions
are difficult to understand. Perhaps, as
Meyer<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> expresses it, "the symptomatology in its first
formulation in 1895, and later, emphasized too many
things which prevail also in other conditions, so that
altogether too many errors occurred. In four hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
and sixty-eight of Kraepelin's Munich diagnoses even
between 1904 and 1906, 28.8 per cent were cases subsequently
considered to be manic-depressive (Zendig)&mdash;altogether
too broad a margin of uncertainty."</p>

<p>In summarizing the whole situation the conclusion
reached by Buckley<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> would appear to be thoroughly
established:&mdash;"Most authorities agree, however, that
the term dementia praecox includes the psychoses which
appear prior to mental maturity (early in some and much
later in others), with a tendency to permanent mental
defect in the long run, but which may follow a chronic
course, may be divided into attacks, or may improve or
stop at any stage, but never with restoration to absolute
normal health."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the elaborate investigations of Alzheimer,
Sioli, Klippel, Lhermitte, Moriyasu, Goldstein,
Nissl and many others, no definite pathological basis
for dementia praecox has ever been established.</p>

<p>For purposes of statistical study in the collection of
data relative to this disease entity, as in all other cases,
the American Psychiatric Association has endeavored to
adhere to fundamental conceptions generally accepted by
the profession and has avoided as far as possible adherence
to the tenets of any one school. For purposes of
uniformity the following suggestions were made in the
"statistical manual" as to the classification of psychoses
to be reported under the designation of dementia praecox.</p>

<p>"This group cannot be satisfactorily defined at the
present time as there are still too many points at issue as
to what constitute the essential clinical features of dementia
praecox. A large majority of the cases which
should go into this group may, however, be recognized
without special difficulty, although there is an important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
smaller group of doubtful, atypical, allied or transitional
cases which from the standpoint of symptoms or
prognosis occupy an uncertain clinical position.</p>

<p>"Cases formerly classed as allied to dementia praecox
should be placed here rather than in the undiagnosed
group. The term "schizophrenia" is now used by many
writers instead of dementia praecox.</p>

<p>"The following mentioned features are sufficiently
well established to be considered most characteristic of
the dementia praecox type of reaction:</p>

<p>"A seclusive type of personality or one showing
other evidences of abnormality in the development of the
instincts and feelings.</p>

<p>"Appearance of defects of interest and discrepancies
between thought on the one hand and the behavior-emotional
reactions on the other.</p>

<p>"A gradual blunting of the emotions, indifference or
silliness with serious defects of judgment and often
hypochondriacal complaints, suspicions or ideas of reference.</p>

<p>"Development of peculiar trends, often fantastic
ideas, with odd, impulsive or negativistic conduct not accounted
for by any acute emotional disturbance or impairment
of the sensorium.</p>

<p>"Appearance of autistic thinking and dream-like
ideas, peculiar feelings of being forced, of interference
with the mind, of physical or mystical influences, but with
retention of clearness in other fields (orientation, memory,
etc.).</p>

<p>"According to the prominence of certain symptoms
in individual cases the following four clinical forms of
dementia praecox may be specified, but it should be
borne in mind that these are only relative distinctions
and that transitions from one clinical form to another
are common:</p>

<p>"(a) Paranoid type: Cases characterized by a prominence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
of delusions, particularly ideas of persecution or
grandeur, often connectedly elaborated, and hallucinations
in various fields.</p>

<p>"(b) Catatonic type: Cases in which there is a
prominence of negativistic reactions or various peculiarities
of conduct with phases of stupor or excitement, the
latter characterized by impulsive, queer or stereotyped
behavior and usually hallucinations.</p>

<p>"(c) Hebephrenic type: Cases showing prominently
a tendency to silliness, smiling, laughter, grimacing, mannerisms
in speech and action, and numerous peculiar
ideas usually absurd, grotesque and changeable in form.</p>

<p>"(d) Simple type: Cases characterized by defects of
interest, gradual development of an apathetic state, often
with peculiar behavior, but without expression of delusions
or hallucinations.</p>

<p>"(e) Other types."</p>

<p>A sufficient number of reports has been received from
hospitals using this classification to warrant a preliminary
survey of the information available at this time on
the subject of dementia praecox. Perhaps it would be
well to summarize first such information as is to be obtained
from other sources. Diefendorf<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> states that
dementia praecox constitutes from fourteen to thirty per
cent of all admissions to institutions, fifty-eight per cent
of the total number being of the hebephrenic, eighteen per
cent, of the catatonic, and twenty-two per cent, of the
paranoid variety. Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> (1913) found that dementia
praecox constituted ten per cent of all admissions,
classified as to types as follows:&mdash;Silly dementia, thirteen
per cent; simple depressive dementia, ten per cent;
delusional depressive dementia, thirteen per cent; circular
dementia, nine per cent; agitated dementia, fourteen
per cent; periodic dementia, two per cent; and katatonia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
19.5 per cent. He reported a history of hereditary
taint in seventy per cent of his cases. Diefendorf found
the onset of the disease in sixty per cent of all cases before
the twenty-fifth year, Kraepelin, in fifty-seven per
cent. Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> states that seizures occurred in
twenty-one per cent of his cases of silly dementia and
in the other types as follows:&mdash;simple depressive dementia,
seventeen per cent; delusional depressive dementia,
twenty-seven per cent; circular dementia,
twenty per cent; agitated dementia, twenty per cent; katatonia,
seventeen per cent; paranoid dementia gravis,
three per cent and paranoid dementia mitis, five per cent.
Unfortunately a survey of the other literature of the
day throws little additional light on these subjects.</p>

<p>A study of the statistical reports made by Pollock for
the State Hospital Commission shows that during the five
years ending on June 30, 1919, dementia praecox constituted
14.42 per cent of the 2,024 voluntary cases admitted
to the thirteen New York state hospitals. During a period
of eight years ending on June 30, 1919, there were
49,640 first admissions to the New York state hospitals;
12,199, or 24.57 per cent, of these were diagnosed as
dementia praecox or conditions allied thereto. The
"allied" conditions have not been shown in the New
York reports since 1917. In 1918 and 1919 there were
13,588 first admissions, 3,753, or 27.61 per cent, of which
were cases of dementia praecox. This would indicate an
increase in the incidence of that disease in New York
during recent years. The Massachusetts first admissions
for 1918 and 1919 show a total of 7,582 cases, 1900, or
25.05 per cent, of which were dementia praecox. It will
be noted that the percentage is practically the same as
that of New York for the same years. In a group of
twenty-one other state hospitals, representing fourteen
different states using the Association's classification,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
18,336 first admissions have been reported, 3,856, or
21.03 per cent, of which were cases of dementia praecox.
This represents a variation from the New York and
Massachusetts findings which can be explained on various
grounds, largely by the fact that these institutions represent
a rural population. We have thus in all 70,987 first
admissions to state hospitals, with 16,920 cases of dementia
praecox, representing 23.84 per cent of the total
number.</p>

<p class="p2b">A consideration of the different types of this disease
as represented by the various state institutions shows
somewhat different results. In New York during the
years 1916-17-18-19 there were 6,135 cases of dementia
praecox shown in the first admissions, classified as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p10">Although this is probably the largest group of cases of
dementia praecox recorded we are, unfortunately, not
warranted as yet in attempting any final conclusions.
The Massachusetts and New York statistics of late years
would, I think, justify the tentative statement, at least,
that dementia praecox admissions represent approximately
twenty-eight per cent of all cases coming into our
hospitals.</p>

<p>When we attempt to analyze the types of the disease
as reported, it at once becomes evident that there are
very divergent standards of diagnosis. There is a radical
difference shown in the consideration of the so-called
simple dementia praecox with a general average of 8.33
per cent. In Massachusetts there is a much higher percentage
of the catatonic forms, with a predominance in
New York of the paranoid variety. The proportion of
hebephrenic types in the other nineteen institutions is at
wide variance with the reports of Massachusetts and
New York. In all probability the percentage shown in
the analysis of the total number from forty-six state
hospitals is not far from representing conditions existing
in American institutions. A careful study of more complete
reports extending over a number of years should
settle this question to what may be spoken of as almost
a mathematical certainty.</p>

Of these cases 52.2 per cent were men and 47.8 per cent,

<p class="p10">This would not appear to suggest an adolescent origin
for this disease to the extent advocated in our textbooks.
The highest rate shown by males was in the age group
from twenty-five to twenty-nine years and in the female
cases, from thirty-five to thirty-nine years. Forty-nine
per cent were thirty years or over at the time of admission,
forty-three per cent were between twenty and thirty
years of age and thirty per cent, between thirty and forty.
Nineteen per cent were forty years or over at the time
of admission. Pollock's<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> investigation, the most exhaustive
statistical study yet made of dementia praecox,
shows that fifty per cent of the cases have a family history
of insanity, nervous diseases, alcoholism or neuropathic
or psychopathic traits, with a full fifty per cent
showing no evidence of unfavorable heredity. This again
is at variance with opinions usually expressed on this
subject. Forty-six per cent were of normal mental
makeup and seventy-eight per cent intellectually normal
before the onset of the psychosis. Alcohol was an assigned
etiological factor in four per cent of these cases
and there was a history of intemperance in eight per
cent of the others. The incidence of dementia praecox is
more than three times as great in cities as it is in the
rural districts. The average length of hospital residence
was sixteen years. The foreign born dementia praecox
first admissions were found to be principally from Austria,
Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and Russia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Fifty-one and four-tenths per cent of the cases were
natives of this country and 48.3 per cent, of foreign birth.
It is interesting to note that in 1919, 39.9 per cent of the
first admissions to the New York institutions for the
criminal insane were cases of dementia praecox. The
rate of admission was 37.1 per cent in 1918, 20.5 per
cent in 1917, 30.8 per cent in 1916 and 32.8 per cent in
1915. Of the 37,607 patients in the New York state hospitals
on June 30, 1919, 22,036, or 58.8 per cent, were
cases of dementia praecox. One hundred and thirty-eight
were discharged as recovered during a period of
three years. This number represented 5.2 per cent of
the cases of dementia praecox discharged during that
time, 2.01 per cent of those admitted, 1.1 per cent of all
discharges, and .6 per cent of all first admissions. A
review of the cause of death in 2,988 cases shows that
the rate for tuberculosis was thirty-three per cent during
four years when there was no influenza epidemic. This
constituted over fifty-nine per cent of all of the deaths
due to tuberculosis during that period of time.</p>

<p>Dementia praecox with the highest admission rate of
any of the psychoses, its exceedingly unfavorable recovery
rate, its extreme susceptibility to tuberculosis,
and representing as it does over one-half of the population
of our hospitals, must unquestionably be looked
upon as the most important form of mental disease with
which we have to deal today. The number of cases of
dementia praecox in the Massachusetts and New York
hospitals justifies the statement that there are approximately
120,000 persons suffering from this disease in the
institutions of the United States, their maintenance alone
costing the country twenty-five million dollars annually.
Their permanent removal would make it possible to close
at least sixty institutions larger than any state hospital
in Massachusetts.</p>

<span class="st">PARANOIA AND THE PARANOID CONDITIONS</span></h3>
</div>

<p>A discussion of the part played by paranoia, or the
paranoid conditions however characterized, in the psychiatry
of the present day, is essentially a review of the
final chapter in the history of a psychiatric conception
which is several centuries old. The word paranoia, like
many other terms still in use, is of Greek origin and was
apparently applied by Hippocrates in a very general way
to "madness" of any or all forms. It almost certainly
had no more definite significance than that, in the works
of Plato and Aristotle, nor can it be said to have been
used in its modern sense by Celsus or Aretaeus. It seems
to have meant something more in the vocabulary of
Vogel, an eighteenth century writer. Under the heading
of paranoia, according to Jelliffe,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Plocquet in 1772 included
Paracope or delirium with six <span class="no-break">subdivisions:&mdash;</span>(a)
pathetica, (b) phronestica, (c) entomica, (d) encephalica,
(e) hyperesthetica, and (f) sympathica. It was not
recognized to any great extent by the earlier writers of
the French school, but occupied a very prominent place
in the development of German psychiatry. Heinroth in
1818 included the paranoias in his disorders of the intellect
under the name of verrücktheit, a word that was
destined to become one of great importance later, and
spoke of an exaltation of the feelings which he called
"paranoia ecstasia."</p>

<p>Flemming<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
in his elaborate classification of psychoses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
in 1844 described paranoid forms of "mania adstricta"
or partial mania (monomania). Stark, a contemporary
of Flemming's, made what seems to be a very
direct reference to paranoia in his discussion of "Wahnsinn,"
as did Weiss in 1842. Von Feuchtersleben in
1845 wrote a very exhaustive description of "fixed delusions"
which he classified as either involving the personality
(mania metamorphosis) or as being ambitious,
religious or relating to love (erotomania). He also spoke
of a monomania or mania sine delirio which he attributed
to Pinel. The exact significance of these conceptions
cannot be determined.</p>

<p>In 1845 Griesinger used the word verrücktheit as applying
to a secondary incurable condition, exhibiting delusions
of persecution and grandeur and usually developing
after an attack of mania or melancholia. He also
defined Wahnsinn, which he compared to Heinroth's
"paranoia ecstasia," as including "states of exaltation
characterized by assertive, expansive emotions, associated
with persistent excessive self-estimation and extravagant
fixed delusions which arise therefrom."
Magnan spoke of "folie systematisée progressive" and
a "folie systematisée des dégénérés." In his "Le Délire
Chronique à Évolution Systematique" he divided paranoia
into a stage of subjective analysis, one of persecution
and a third of transformation of the personality.
Lasègue described this same condition under the name of
persecution mania in 1852. Falret and Ritti divided the
course of this disease into four periods, one of insane
interpretations, one of visual hallucinations, one of general
sensory derangement and a stereotyped state or
mania of ambition. Morel was of the opinion that these
psychoses were always preceded by an initial period of
hypochondriasis.</p>

<p>Pritchard described as monomania a form of insanity
"characterized by some particular illusion or erroneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
conviction impressed upon the understanding, and giving
rise to a partial aberration of judgment." Esquirol
devoted as many as one hundred and thirty pages to a
study of monomania, which he subdivided into seven
<span class="no-break">forms:&mdash;the</span> erotic, "raisonnante" or moral insanity, the
alcoholic, the incendiary, the homicidal, the suicidal and
the hypochondriacal.</p>

<p>It was probably the work of Mendel in 1881 which was
responsible for the use of the word paranoia in its modern
sense. He spoke of primary and secondary paranoias.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
The former was described as a "functional psychosis
characterized by the primary appearance of delusional
ideas. The delusions of primary paranoia, without being
interfered with by any opposing ideas, control the entire
mental life of the patient. The remaining ideas not affected
by morbid processes stand in close relation, but
not in conflict, with the dominating delusions. The feelings
are determined by the content of the delusions and
vary with them. In the same way the abnormalities of
conduct are due to the content of the delusional ideas,
with or without hallucinations." Régis in 1892 described
his systematized progressive insanity as involving three
distinct stages,&mdash;one of subjective analysis, a stage either
of persecution, religious exaltation or eroticism and jealousy,
and finally a megalomanic state ending occasionally
in dementia. Cramer, in an elaborate review of the
literature of paranoia in 1894, refers to twenty-eight different
designations used by various writers in the discussion
of this subject up to that time. Serieux and
Copgras (1909) include deliria of interpretation and of
vindication in their grouping of these conditions.</p>

<p>In the words of Meyer, paranoia eventually reached
its high water mark in the work of Krafft-Ebing.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
defined it as "a chronic mental disease occurring exclusively
in tainted individuals, frequently developing out
of the constitutional neuroses, the principal symptoms of
which are delusions." These are devoid of all emotional
foundation and from the beginning are systematized,
methodic and "combined by the processes of judgment,
constituting a formal delusional structure. Consciousness
is not disturbed and judgment as a rule is not impaired
but is entirely based on delusional premises." The
conduct of the individual is determined by his hallucinations
and delusions. The process of development is slow
and the disease remains stationary for many years, but
never ends in dementia. In a study of over one thousand
cases Krafft-Ebing<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> never observed a definite recovery,
although lucid intervals occurred, generally in the
beginning of the disease. The taint of paranoia he describes
as heredity, in the form of abnormal character,
psychoses, constitutional neuroses and alcoholism. In a
few instances he reported developmental defects in the
brain. He found in all cases an anomaly of personality
which determined the later form of the paranoia. Suspicious,
retiring, solitary persons were usually persecuted.
Rough, irritable, egotistical individuals developed
the querulent forms and the over-conscientious eccentrics
became the victims of religious paranoia. He attaches
a considerable importance to the influence of the unconscious
or subconscious mind. "Its predominance is
shown in the dreamy, romantic, enthusiastic life of such
individuals, and in the fact that accidental delusions occurring
in sickness, dream pictures, and reminiscences
from reading or plays, are elaborated in the depths of the
soul, and early burst forth in the form of imperative
ideas and desultory primordial delusions, which become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
latent, but later find their ultimate evaluation in the delusional
ideas of the disease."</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Krafft-Ebing speaks of
precipitating factors as puberty, the climacteric, uterine
disease and onanism. There is a definite period of incubation
followed by one of full development in which judgment
and reason are lost. Hallucinations of hearing were
found to be the more common form, followed in the order
of their numerical occurrence by disturbances of sensibility,
vision, taste and smell. Persecutory ideas, moreover,
were said to be much more frequent than delusions
of grandeur. The terminal states he speaks of as mental
enfeeblements with a prominence of emotional dulness,
rather than intellectual defects. He divides the disease
into original paranoia and the later or acquired forms.
Original paranoia begins before or at latest during
puberty. Hereditary taint is always to be found. Conspicuous
features are sentimental tendencies inclining to
hypochondria, eroticism with sensitiveness and emotional
instability. Delusions as to parentage are common,
suggested often by the fancied or real resemblance of the
patient to pictures of distinguished personages. Transitory
ideas of persecution or grandeur are nearly always
present. The erotic element is more frequent in females.
Intermissions sometimes last for years. The termination
is often found in confusional states. The classic or acquired
form of the disease develops later in life, often
during the involution period. Two varieties are described,&mdash;the
persecutory and the expansive. Subsidiary
types of the former are sexual paranoia, often with
delusions of jealousy, and querulous insanity with mania
for lawsuits. The sexual complex he attributes largely
to masturbation or enforced abstinence. The expansive
group is divided into inventive or reformatory paranoia,
the religious and the erotic varieties (erotomania). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
acquired form as described by Krafft-Ebing is quite
similar to the "folie systematisée" of Magnan. It conforms,
moreover, in a general way to the views expressed
in the English textbooks on delusional insanity and is
the paranoia of Spitzka, Chapin, Berkley, Peterson and
many other American psychiatrists. This conception of
the psychosis was the generally accepted one for many
years.</p>

<p>The institutional reports of that day showed large
numbers of paranoics in some of the hospitals. It was a
disease that played an important part in many murder
trials and has received more attention from the courts
and newspapers than any other form of insanity, so-called,
ever described in the textbooks. There was a
time, according to Kraepelin, when from seventy to eighty
per cent of the patients in the German hospitals were
diagnosed as cases of genuine paranoia. Certainly that
cannot be said of the institutions of this country. In the
New York state hospitals, for instance, during a period of
sixteen years, from October 1, 1888, to September 30,
1904, when the classical form of paranoia was officially
recognized in statistics, 84,152 admissions were reported.
Of this number 1,655, or 1.9 per cent, were diagnosed as
cases of paranoia. At the Matteawan State Hospital for
the criminal insane during this time 1,728 admissions
were shown, with no cases of paranoia. At the Dannemora
State Hospital for insane convicts during the same
period there were 354 admissions, sixteen, or 4.51 per
cent, of which were paranoiacs. This is exceedingly interesting
but extremely difficult to explain. It is very
hard to understand why no cases of paranoia reached
Matteawan during a period of sixteen years. The percentage
shown in the other institutions can be looked
upon as being fairly representative of the incidence of
paranoia as the disease was then understood.</p>

<p>The decline and fall of the paranoia concept is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
attributed to Kraepelin. In 1893 his classification included
hallucinatory and depressive forms of "Wahnsinn," both
accompanied by persecutory ideas to a rather prominent
degree, and paranoia proper, which he described as
"Verrücktheit." This was defined as the "chronic development
of a permanent delusional system with complete
preservation of consciousness". In the sixth
edition of his well-known textbook, which appeared in
1899, he enlarged the dementia praecox group previously
described by him and added hebephrenia and katatonia
to it as well as describing a new and important "paranoid"
form of that disease. His own reasons for this
were stated as follows<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>:&mdash;"The second clinical group"
(dementia praecox, paranoid form) "which I am
inclined, provisionally, to include under this head, is
characterized by the fact that extravagant delusions,
usually accompanied by numerous hallucinations, develop
in a more coherent manner, and are maintained during a
series of years, either then entirely to disappear, or to
become entirely confused. Hitherto I have reckoned
these forms, as 'phantastische Verrücktheit' to paranoia,
as is the general practice. It has, however, gradually
become clearer to me that they are at all events, more
nearly allied to dementia praecox than to paranoia.
Whether we really have to do in this case only with a
clinical variety of the former disease or a distinct malady,
the future must decide." He did, however, at that time
still recognize a small but well defined group of cases as
genuine paranoia. "On the other hand, there is, without
doubt, a group of cases, in which it is clearly recognizable
from the outset that a permanent, immovable
system of delusions slowly develops, with entire preservation
of mental clearness, and of the regulation of the
course of thought. It is these forms for which I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
reserve the appellation of paranoia. It is they which necessarily
lead to a profound transformation of the entire
view of life; to a dislocation of the point of view which
the patient assumes toward the persons and events of his
environment." In the eighth edition of his book (1913)
he separates out a considerable number of cases and
places them in an entirely new group designated as
"paraphrenias."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> This is "a comparatively small group
in which, in spite of many similarities to the manifestations
of dementia praecox nevertheless on account of
the much less marked development of emotional and
volitional disturbances the inner structure of the mental
life is considerably less affected, or in which at least the
loss of inner unity is essentially limited to certain intellectual
functions. Common to all of these clinical forms
which cannot be sharply differentiated is the marked
prominence of delusion formation and the paranoid
colouring of the disease process. At the same time there
are also alterations in the disposition, but not until the
last stages of the disease that dulness and indifference
which so often are the first indications of dementia
praecox." In other words, we are dealing with a group
which shows the paranoid features of dementia praecox
but largely lacks its deteriorative processes. This is a
very decided change of views and may be looked upon
either as establishing a definite status for a large number
of cases not properly accounted for in the past or as an
indication of a tendency to return to former conceptions
of paranoia.</p>

<p>Of the paraphrenias as described by Kraepelin "approximately
one-half show that slow but progressively
developing mixture of delusions of persecution and
grandeur which Magnan has described under the designation
of 'délire chronique à évolution systematique.'
Certainly this disease of Magnan's, as far as can be determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
from the descriptions available, is not a clinical
entity in the sense of the views expressed here; we
would unhesitatingly include with the paranoid forms of
dementia praecox many of the cases, with well developed
mannerisms and the coinage of new words, which progress
rapidly to mental enfeeblement. At the same time,
however, 'délire chronique' with its slowly progressing
forms lasting for decades includes a number of cases
which form the nucleus of the first paraphrenic disease
group to be described." Whether or not the paraphrenia
of Kraepelin is accepted as having been established,
it must be conceded that the question as to whether anything
remains of the original paranoia group is one
worthy of serious consideration. Many have discarded
the term entirely.</p>

<p>Kraepelin's paraphrenia is divided into the following
forms:&mdash;systematica, expansiva, confabulans and phantastica.
The systematic type is characterized by "the
extremely insidious development of continuously progressing
delusions of persecution, with the later appearance
of delusions of grandeur without deterioration of
the personality." The expansive form shows "the
prominent development of delusions of grandeur with a
predominant exalted mood and mild excitement." The
confabulans variety is a small group "distinguished by
the prominent rôle played by falsifications of memory."
The phantastic form shows "a marked development of
phantastic, unsystematized, changeable delusions." This
was the paranoid dementia praecox of his sixth edition.
Of the cases heretofore assigned to the paranoia group
Kraepelin has expressed the opinion that about forty per
cent belong to dementia praecox. "A further somewhat
larger part falls to the paraphrenic forms to be described
here." The practically negligible remainder he
apparently concedes to genuine paranoia. In his eighth
edition Kraepelin states that the latter constitute less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
than one per cent of all admissions. He now limits the
term paranoia to cases arising from purely internal
causes and showing a slowly developing permanent system
of delusions without any disturbance of thought,
volition or conduct. The delusional formations may be
of various types,&mdash;persecution, jealousy, self-importance
(great inventions, ideas of noble birth, etc.) or they may
be of a religious or erotic nature. The "querulents" he
now classifies with the psychogenic disorders. His present
conception does not admit of the association of paranoia
with hallucinations.</p>

<p>The most interesting and important feature, perhaps,
of Kraepelin's presentation is his insistence upon internal
causes only as etiological factors. He assumes
a psychopathic foundation for the development of the
disease. In more than one half of his cases he found well
marked personal peculiarities. These were manifested
in some instances in the form of irritability, excitability
and abnormalities of conduct. Other individuals were suspicious,
unreliable, lacking in will power and over-ambitious.
Homosexual tendencies were not infrequent. External
factors, such as unpleasant experiences, may
influence the form of the delusional expressions but
should not be looked upon as explaining their origin.
They develop in an emotional soil definitely related to
the hopes and fears of the healthy individual and are
to be looked upon as a morbid transformation of perfectly
normal mechanisms. In addition to this he speaks
of an increased self-consciousness, a natural tendency
to resistiveness, an undeveloped type of thinking, psychological
compensations for the disappointments of life,
evidences of developmental inhibitions, improper habits
of thought leading to morbid conceptions, etc. He refers
to exaggerated self-consciousness as the fundamental
basis of paranoia. In this soil delusions develop as a
result of inadequate intellectual processes due to developmental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
inhibitions. All of these views have been
elaborated more fully in his recent discussions of the
subject of "comparative psychiatry."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> These mechanisms,
he says, have not escaped the notice of the
Freudian school. Kraepelin feels, however, that their
arguments "are not based either on a clear conception
of paranoia or on any evidence at all acceptable."</p>

<p>Bleuler's theory of the disease is summed up in the
following quotation from his "Affectivität, Suggestibilität,
Paranoia"<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>:&mdash;"The exact observation of the objective
and subjective relations at the time of the origin
of the disease shows us therefore nothing more than the
appearance of errors, such as occur to normal persons
under analogous affects and a connection of accidental
occurrences to a thought complex which is kept continually
awake by defects and his own trends of thought, just
as it is in a corresponding normal mental process. The
pathological feature is only the fixation of the error so
that it becomes a delusion, and then the further extension
of the delusions so that it finally becomes paranoia." In
1906 when this was written he suggested no explanation
for the extension of such errors and their fixation in an
actual psychosis. This might readily be interpreted as
a logical result of the paranoic "constitution."</p>

<p>The development of paranoic states was summarized
by Meyer<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>"
<span class="smcap">a.</span> Feeling of uneasiness,
tendency to brooding, rumination and sensitiveness, with
inability to correct the notions and to make concessions&mdash;paranoic
constitution and paranoic moods. <span class="smcap">b.</span> Appearance
of dominant notions, suspicious or ill balanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
aims. <span class="smcap">c.</span> False interpretations with self-reference and
tendency to systematization, without or with <span class="smcap">d.</span> Retrospective
or hallucinatory falsifications, etc. <span class="smcap">e.</span> Megalomanic
developments or deterioration or intercurrent
acute episodes. <span class="smcap">f.</span> At any period antisocial and dangerous
reactions may result from the lack of adaptability
and excessive assertion of the sidetracked personality."</p>

<p>Freud sees in paranoia a reversion to the homosexuality
of the developmental period of the individual with
a projection of symptoms resulting from mental conflicts
due to a repression of complexes. He described the sexuality
of the infantile period as being purely autoerotic
in character, the sexual interests of the child being centered
in its own body. From this stage the object of interest
is gradually transferred to other individuals of the
same sex, the normal attraction to the opposite sex being
a final development of later years. Freud believes that
in paranoia there is a fixation in one of these early transitional
stages. "Persons who cannot rise completely out
of the stage of narcissism and are thus prematurely fixed
or arrested in the evolution of their dispositions, are
exposed to the danger that a flood of libido which finds
no outlet, sexualizes their social tendencies and reverts
the sublimations achieved in the course of the development."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
The resulting mechanisms may be looked
upon as defense reactions. The subconscious homosexual
longings of the individual are repressed but finally admitted
to full consciousness in the form of a projection,
the sexual object usually being accused of persecution,
thus justifying the attitude of the paranoic towards the
cause of his troubles. In erotomania the antagonism is
directed not against the homosexual object but upon some
person of the opposite sex. Freud interprets the delusions
of jealousy of the alcoholic as an evidence of homosexual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
attraction, the individual justifying himself by
the charge that it is his wife and not himself who is the
guilty one. The delusions of grandeur he looks upon as
a sweeping denial of all extraneous influences, the individual
building a defense for himself by assuming a self-aggrandizement
that leaves no room for homosexual objects.
Perhaps these mechanisms are, as Meyer suggests,
only another expression of the well recognized and
more or less normal tendency to accuse others of being at
fault in some way when what we do ourselves goes wrong.
Certainly, if nothing more, they are exceedingly ingenious
and interesting theories. One cannot but be impressed
by the extraordinary skill of Freud in discovering the
sexual origin of almost any mental process with which
we are familiar. The ready facility with which his study
of sexual conflicts and repressions can be shown to serve
as a complement to the anatomical, symptomatic, and
prognostic hypotheses of Kraepelin is also worthy of
note.</p>

<p>As has already been said, there is considerable question
as to how much, if anything, remains of the old-time
paranoia concept. The uncertainties attending diagnosis
have given rise to the modifying term "paranoid" which
has been very generally used for many years. It should
be remembered that paranoia when at its best only constituted
approximately two per cent of all psychoses reported
from institutions. These various considerations
have resulted in its not having a distinctive place in the
classification adopted by the American Psychiatric Association
and it has been given official recognition as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"From this group should be excluded the deteriorating
paranoid states and paranoid states symptomatic of
other mental disorders or of some damaging factor such
as alcohol, organic brain disease, etc.</p>

<p>"The group comprises cases which show clinically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
fixed suspicions, persecutory delusions, dominant ideas
or grandiose trends logically elaborated and with due regard
for reality after once a false interpretation or premise
has been accepted. Further characteristics are formally
correct conduct, adequate emotional reactions,
clearness and coherence of the train of thought."</p>

<p>A study of the statistics of American hospitals shows
quite clearly the importance which should be attached
to the paranoid conditions. During 1918 and 1919 there
were 13,588 admissions to the thirteen New York state
hospitals. Two hundred and fifty-six, or 1.88 per cent, of
these were cases of paranoia or paranoid conditions.
During a period of eight years there were 49,640 admissions
of which 1,240, or 2.5 per cent, were paranoid conditions.
In Massachusetts sixty-four, or 2.12 per cent,
of the 3,011 admissions during 1919 were reported as
paranoid conditions. In twenty-one hospitals in other
states there were 18,336 admissions. Of these, 789, or
4.3 per cent, were paranoid conditions. These statistics
show quite a small admission rate for these psychoses
in New York and Massachusetts. The rate in other state
hospitals is noticeably higher. As the percentage for dementia
praecox is considerably lower in the reports from
these institutions than it is in Massachusetts and New
York, it is fairly reasonable to assume that many cases
shown as paranoid forms of dementia praecox in Massachusetts
and New York are classified with the paranoid
conditions in the other states. If we consider the total
admissions from all of the hospitals in question, we find
2,093 paranoid conditions in all, constituting 2.94 per cent
of a total of 70,987 cases. It has already been shown that
paranoia, at a time when it was a well recognized entity,
constituted only 1.9 per cent of over eighty-four thousand
consecutive admissions. This clinical grouping has,
therefore, obviously been enlarged by adding paranoid
conditions which could not probably be classified as well
recognized types of other psychoses.</p>

<span class="st">THE EPILEPTIC PSYCHOSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Ancient history contains numerous references to epilepsy.
The "Morbus sacer" of the Romans was apparently
a subject of great interest to Hippocrates,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> who
wrote, over two thousand years ago, "The sacred disease
appears to me to be no wise more divine nor more sacred
than other diseases; but has a natural cause, from which
it originates like other affections. Men regard its nature
and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder,
because it is not at all like other diseases." Presumably
for a somewhat similar reason the disease was also referred
to as the "Morbus Sideratus," it being thought
that those affected were "star struck" or smitten in some
mysterious and supernatural manner. By others it has
been suggested that the theory regarding the divine origin
of the disease was attributable to the seizures which
always preceded the prophesies of the priests of Apollo.
Herodotus is responsible for the statement that Cambyses,
the king of the Persians, was subject to the "sacred
disease" from birth. Such historians as Hippocrates
and Euripides have definitely established the status of
Hercules as a confirmed epileptic. "Morbus Herculeus"
was one of the earliest designations of the disease. It
was referred to by Plutarch in his writings. Suetonius
describes the emperor Caligula as unquestionably afflicted
with epilepsy. No less an authority than Lombroso
speaks of Napoleon, Molière, Julius Caesar, Petrarch,
Peter the Great, Mohammed, Händel, Swift,
Richelieu, Charles V. Flaubert, Dostoieffsky and St. Paul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
as all being victims of the same affection. Truly this is
a noble assemblage,&mdash;one which might readily make the
disease fashionable!</p>

<p>Maudsley ("Body and Mind") was convinced that
Swedenborg suffered from a form of epileptic insanity.
The following quotation from his diary would lend some
color to that <span class="no-break">theory:&mdash;</span>"There happened to me something
very curious. I came into violent shudderings, as when
Christ showed me His Divine Mercy. The one fit followed
the other ten or fifteen times." After his fifty-fifth
year, according to Maudsley, Swedenborg was permanently
insane. The historian Sloan in his "Life of Napoleon"
accepts as an established fact the statement that
this great military strategist was an epileptic. Appian's
"Roman History" certainly justifies Lombroso's reference
to Julius Caesar: "At length, whether he lost all
hope, or else for the better preservation of his health,
never more afflicted with the falling sickness and sudden
convulsions than when he lay idle, he resolved upon a far
distant expedition against the Gatae and the Parthians."
Washington Irving in speaking of some of the peculiar
experiences of Mohammed suggests that, "Some of his
adversaries attributed them to epilepsy." Even a very
brief review of the historical aspects of this disease
should perhaps not omit the contribution made by Shakespeare:
"My Lord is fallen into an Epilepsie. This is
his second Fit." (<i>Othello</i>)</p>

<p>Epilepsy and the mental disturbances associated with
it are so intimately related that they can hardly be considered
separately. Notwithstanding that fact it must
be admitted that there is no sharply circumscribed clinical
entity properly definable as epilepsy. Nor is there
anything distinctive about the psychotic manifestations
occurring during the course of that disease, although
Tuke's Dictionary mentions over thirty different varieties.
In the most exhaustive study of epilepsy ever made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
in this country Spratling<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> reported that memory defects
were noted in ninety per cent of the patients examined
by him. It should be borne in mind that the
group studied did not include any committed mental
cases. He found from eight to ten per cent so slightly
affected as to be legally "sane," "except at the brief moment
of attack." Fifty per cent were mentally incompetent
with rational intervals and forty per cent were "continually
irresponsible." This latter class included from
twenty to twenty-five per cent of imbeciles and idiots
and from fifteen to twenty per cent recognizable as insane
"by law and medicine alike." The prevalence of
mental disease in a hospital population composed exclusively
of epileptics is shown by his statement that of 801
patients examined at Craig Colony forty-one could not
tell their own names; 166 did not know their age; 267
could not name the year, 263 the month, and 226 the day
of the week; 238 did not know where they were; 378 were
unable to state the year of their birth, 183 the last place
of residence, 219 the name of the institution, and 248 the
length of time there; in addition to this, 224 could not
write well enough to sign their own names. It is interesting
to note that the disease had its onset in 38.5 per
cent of his cases before the age of ten years, in 43.5 per
cent between the ages of ten and twenty, and in 9.5 per
cent between the ages of nineteen and twenty-nine. Gowers
found that seventy-six per cent developed symptoms
before the age of twenty. Spratling classified the mental
conditions found in epileptics as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>Psychic epilepsy,
epileptic automatism, pre- and postparoxysmal
mental disturbances, paroxysmal states (epileptic mania),
and interparoxysmal conditions. The latter included
transitory ill-humor, slight dulling or clouding of the intellect,
feeblemindedness, imbecility, idiocy, epileptic dementia
and acute confusional insanity which he says belongs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
to the manic-depressive group. He warns against
the danger of classifying as dementia conditions due entirely
to the use of bromides.</p>

<p>L. Pierce Clark<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> looks upon epilepsy as the logical
development of a well defined individual make-up described
as the "epileptic constitution" and existing from
the earliest childhood. In support of that theory he has
reviewed the contributions of other writers on this subject.
He found that Vogt called attention to the epileptic
"poverty of ideas, prolonged reaction time, egocentricity,
many religious reactions and acts of servility."
Jung referred to a series of superficial associations, influencing
the ideas of the patient, somewhat similar to
those occurring in imbecility and sometimes observed in
normal individuals of the uneducated class. Roemer
speaks of a disturbance of "secondary identification" involving
memory pictures with special sense recognition
unimpaired. Eintinger described an essential poverty
of affectivity and Wiersma, periodical variations in attentiveness.
Ritterhaus defined the epileptic mental content
as one of poverty of ideas, prolonged reaction time, egocentricity,
emotional reactions and circumstantiality.
Arndt included in the epileptic character peculiar inward
fervor, characteristically egotistic in nature, and resembling
the alcoholic temperament. Bianchi believed that
the disease developed on a personality basis strongly
suggesting the criminal type. He spoke of an inadaptability
to the environment, the preponderance of individualistic
instinct, cruelty, laziness, evil life, precocious and
excessive development of the sexual instinct, irascibility
and impulsiveness. Turner described an epileptic "temperament."
He found these individuals to be egotistical,
conceited, pretentious in conversation, emotionally unstable
and sometimes obstinate or over-religious. Hartmann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
and di Gaspero noted as prodromal manifestations,
abnormal changes of temper, excitability, anxious fears,
sudden depressions, restlessness, irritability, distrust,
memory falsifications, and violent impulses. Voisin
found that less than ten per cent of epileptics showed a
perfect balance in the emotional make-up. Hübner expressed
the opinion that true dipsomania occurs chiefly
in epileptics. He found alternations in the character of
the individual in from ninety to ninety-five per cent of
his cases.</p>

<p>Clark's<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> conclusions were summarized by him as
<span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>"1. There is more or less constant affective
defect in all epileptics, sane as well as insane; that such
defect is due to an inherent make-up of the psyche in
which mainly an egocentricity and a highly sensitized
feeling are given to the individual; and that from this
constitutional make-up or alteration the ultimate deterioration
of the psyche, intellectually as well as emotionally,
is gradually developed, step by step, and if the
state is not corrected that this finally and logically ends
in so-called epileptic dementia. 2. The epileptic alteration
is seen to proceed from the mental make-up or
constitution of the individual epileptic long before his
malady reaches the convulsive stage and that the one
is but a further and final unfoldment of the former."
As Clark expresses it, "The nucleus of this personality
defect is a temperament of extreme hypersensitiveness
and egotism and all that these two main characteristics
entail ... a personality defect which makes its possessor
incapable of social adaptation in its best setting
and which, if it remains uncorrected, renders the individual
inadequate to make a normal adult life." He
looks upon the epileptic reaction as a "more or less
direct outcome of the epileptic's inability to stand the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
stress and harassments of life from which he seeks automatic
or unconscious withdrawal." This exhibits itself
as a loss of spontaneous interest, day-dreaming, lethargy,
somnolence, etc., terminating finally in epileptiform attacks
when the strain becomes too great. A rather complete
description of the "epileptic character" appeared
in Schüle's "Klinische Psychiatrie" in 1886.</p>

<p>An analysis of these mental mechanisms leads naturally
to certain therapeutic indications. In view of the
history of the bromide therapy, since the time of its introduction
by Laycock as the ideal form of treatment
in 1851, such suggestions should be given serious consideration.
Clark advocates the early use of educational
methods in correcting the defects of the epileptic constitution.
Thus he would obtain control of the egocentricity
and hypersensitiveness by reducing environmental
stresses, teaching adjustment to the surroundings, and
finding suitable and normal outlets for the spontaneous
desires of the individual. He is of the opinion that in
the apparently deteriorated cases mental interests can be
restored and emotional and mental dilapidation greatly
improved. He has reported a series of cases showing
that the frequency and severity of seizure can be greatly
influenced "with the more or less permanent arrest of
the disorder in not a few cases."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> A subsequent study
of the mental mechanisms involved was summarized by
Clark<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> in these words: "It is fairly obvious that the
mental content in epilepsy proves that the epileptic regresses
from the displeasurable difficulties of life, and in
the first states of the fit the stress alone may be uncovered;
whenever the patient reaches a deeper unconscious
state, he gains the level of an easily recognized sexual
striving."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> would differentiate between "symptomatic"
forms of epilepsy due to organic diseases, injuries
or growths; and the "genuine" variety not associated
with any coarse brain lesion. He describes as indications
of impending attacks, occurring several hours or
even days before, headache, irritable ill-tempered moods,
general discomfort, weakness, palpitations, oppression,
anxiety, vertigo, nausea, hot and cold sensations, sense
deceptions of various kinds, muscular twitching, sexual
excitement, disturbed sleep, unpleasant dreams, etc.
Binswanger found these symptoms present usually in
the severer forms of the disease. Finkh found them in
twenty-five per cent of his cases. Psychic, sensory, motor
and vasomotor aura are described. Kraepelin after discussing
first the paroxysmal attacks occurring in the disease
speaks of the various forms of psychic epilepsy as
constituting the second important group of clinical manifestations
to be considered. These conditions may be
looked upon as pre- or post-epileptic insanity, depending
on their relation to convulsions, or may be entirely independent
of them or considered as equivalents.</p>

<p>The most common form of psychic epilepsy he describes
as periodical ill-humor. It begins sometimes with
sexual excitement (Ducosté). The patient becomes
moody, surly, irritable, quarrelsome, gives up his work,
refuses to eat and complains of everything around him.
In some cases uneasiness, gloom or depression are manifested
and suicidal tendencies may develop. Consciousness
is clear although the patients complain that they
cannot think or are confused and forgetful. Some have
headache, perspire, show dilated pupils, vasomotor disturbances,
nausea, etc. The picture is often complicated
by alcoholic indulgence with attacks resembling dipsomania.
This sometimes results in an epileptic clouded
or dream state in which the patients become blustering,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
abusive, and violent or make senseless journeys. They
may manifest a sudden impulse to wander from place
to place without any apparent reason. Sexual excitement
frequently occurs, with masturbation and exhibitionism,
attacks on children or homosexual tendencies. Usually
there is no recollection of these episodes. Occasionally
expansive or ecstatic moods appear and rarely a flight of
ideas is noted. These attacks of ill-humor usually last
from a few hours to several days, often disappearing suddenly.
Alcoholism always lengthens the duration. In
some cases active hallucinations and clouding of consciousness
occur. Dreams are common. Others show
anxious states with hallucinations and sometimes well
marked delusions. An actual delirium may appear, although
usually only for a very short time. The hallucinations
and delusions may persist for months, suggesting
dementia praecox.</p>

<p>A second large group shows a more marked clouding
of consciousness. These are the characteristic twilight
or dream states of epilepsy. Thought is confused, desultory,
retarded or incoherent. Sometimes there is a
tendency to rhyme and repeat questions, or even a genuine
flight of ideas. The mood may be depressed, anxious
or irritable, although ecstatic states occur. The patient
may become quiet, inaccessible, stuporous or cataleptic.
Some, however, become excited. Later, defects
of memory occur and amnesic periods may extend over
a considerable length of time. The patellar reflexes may
be increased and the pupils dilated and sluggish. There
may be a contraction of the field of vision or disturbance
of color sense, tactile sensation, smell and taste, with
muscular weakness, Babinski reflexes, speech defects,
dizziness, uncertain gait, nystagmus, etc. Somnambulism
is sometimes encountered in epilepsy, although it is
strongly suggestive of hysteria. The great majority of
cases present the picture of a simple dreamy stuporous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
condition. Apprehension is clouded, the patients become
confused, cannot control their thoughts, mistake the
persons around them, lose themselves on the street, and
wander away. They destroy their clothes, undress in the
street, etc. Sexual excitement, exhibitionism and masturbation
are common. Characteristic dream states may
appear as equivalents.</p>

<p>A delirious confusion with hallucinations and delusions
often develops. Some cases have a very strong religious
coloring and believe themselves to be in heaven
or hell&mdash;hear the voice of God, angels, etc. Grandiose
ideas may appear and wonderful adventures are narrated.
The mood is variable and may be either anxious, cheerful
or erotic. There is a marked tendency to violence and
the patients may be very restless and agitated. Delusions
are common and often lead to suicidal attempts. Some
exhibit an anxious delirium accompanied by numerous
hallucinations. The patient is clouded as well as disoriented
and delusions develop early. Fabrications sometimes
appear in this condition. These deliria may last
a few hours or several weeks. Profound and more or less
long continued epileptic stupors may complicate the situation.</p>

<p>A "conscious delirium" of longer duration is observed
in some instances. The sensorium is not so much clouded,
and the patient appears quite clear. Hallucinations and
illusions usually develop early in the attack. Pleasurable,
grandiose ideas often appear. The attitude in a general
way resembles that of a confused disorientation. Anxious
moods may develop, or rarely cheerful tendencies.
Consciousness becomes dreamy, with hallucinations of a
religious coloring. Patients with an apparently clear
sensorium may commit numerous foolish or even criminal
acts without any apparent insight into their significance.
Such conditions as this may last weeks or months. Self-accusation
may occur between attacks. These individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
are quite likely to start on absolutely aimless journeys
which may be the outcome of an alcoholic debauch. The
dream state in such cases may have a decided alcoholic
coloring with characteristic hallucinations or humorous
tendencies. This may be mixed with religious ecstatic
manifestations. Dream states only occur once or twice
during the lifetime of an epileptic or may be comparatively
frequent. Many patients never have them.</p>

<p>Aschaffenburg found fainting attacks in seventy-four
per cent, convulsions in forty-two per cent, stupors in
forty-four, petit mal in fifty-eight, dream states in thirty-six,
and ill-humor in from sixty-four to seventy per cent
of his cases. In his Munich clinic Kraepelin studied 515
epileptics. Eighty-six and eight-tenths per cent of them
had attacks of unconsciousness, probably often reported
as convulsions, 23.3 per cent had dizzy spells, 9.7 per cent
stupors, 15.1 per cent petit mal, 3.3 per cent attacks of
various kinds without unconsciousness, 16.5 per cent
dream states, 1.9 per cent somnambulisms, 36.9 per cent
ill-humor, 13.8 per cent excitements, mostly alcoholic complications,
and 2.5 per cent had status epilepticus.</p>

<p>An epileptic weakmindedness develops in many cases.
The field of thought is contracted and egocentric in character
with delayed associations as shown by Jung. The
patient is egotistical, interested in petty details, and
strongly inclined to religious tendencies. He always
minimizes the severity of the disease which, in his opinion,
is improving rapidly. He is likely to develop mild
paranoid ideas and feels that he has been mistreated or
that others are prejudiced against him. These individuals
are usually moody, irritable, dull, emotionally unstable
and excitable. They are often overactive but not
industrious. Many show a persistent "wanderlust."
Werther reported that between seven and eight per cent
of his cases were tramps or beggars. Quite a few show
criminal tendencies. They nearly always have a marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
susceptibility to alcohol which greatly aggravates their
symptoms. Kraepelin is inclined to look upon the epileptic
personality as a result of the disease and not the
soil in which it develops.</p>

<p>In the more advanced deteriorations or epileptic dementias
there is a marked mental dulness with poverty
of thought, loss of memory, irascibility and occasional
violence. Kraepelin refers to a genuine "epileptic physiognomy"
which is often observed. Strabismus, nystagmus,
ptosis, tremors and many other neurological
symptoms are frequently found. Clark and Scripture
have described a characteristic "voice" in epilepsy.
Besta found a subnormal temperature in sixty-six per
cent of his cases. Very elaborate studies of the blood
have been reported from time to time. The secretions
and excretions have been made the subject of exhaustive
research and the changes in metabolism have been gone
into thoroughly.</p>

<p>The pathology of epilepsy has been given careful consideration
by Alzheimer. In cases of status epilepticus
he found extensive acute alterations, more particularly
in the Betz cells, with swelling of the neurones, crumbling
of the Nissl bodies, and dislocation of the nucleus to the
apex. Here and there the ganglion cells were entirely
destroyed and others showed regressive changes. Karyokinetic
figures are seen in the glia cells, which are usually
swollen, show ameboid changes and contain degenerative
products. Accumulations of broken down cell
products are found around the vessels. A sclerosis of
the cornu ammonis, usually unilateral, was reported by
Bourneville in 14.8 per cent, by Pfleger in fifty-eight per
cent, and by Alzheimer in from fifty to sixty per cent of
the cases of epilepsy examined. This consists of an atrophy
of the cells in a well defined area and their replacement
by a network of fibres. The cells are shrunken or
entirely gone, while there is a great increase in the neuroglia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
elements with many free nuclei. The walls of the
vessels are thickened and "stäbchenzellen" appear. The
significance of these findings is not known. Nissl looks
upon them as only a part of a general involvement of the
cortex. Widespread cell changes were frequently reported
by both Nissl and Alzheimer. A marked increase
in the neuroglia has been found particularly in the superficial
layers of the cortex,&mdash;the so-called "marginal
gliosis" of Chaslin. The vessels show an intimal proliferation
and a thickening of the walls, with occasional mast-cells
in the lymph spaces. Ranke has called attention to
the presence or persistence of "Cajal" cells in the ordinarily
cell free layers of the cortex. These are large transversely
placed ganglion cells, common in the superficial
layers of the cortex of the newborn but not found in the
normal adult brain. This condition is looked upon as a
cortical development defect. These so-called "Cajal"
cells are also found in some of the mental deficiencies.
Nevertheless it must be conceded that there are no definitely
characteristic pathological changes so constant as
to render certain the differentiation of this disease postmortem.</p>

<p>No forms of insanity perhaps are clinically so difficult
and unsatisfactory from the standpoint of classification
as are the epileptic psychoses. The various mental manifestations
of the disease may very logically be described
as: 1. Pre-paroxysmal episodes, 2. Paroxysmal states,
3. Post-paroxysmal episodes, 4. Inter-paroxysmal conditions
to be specified, as excitements, depressions, anxieties,
confusion, stupor, dream states, paranoid conditions,
etc., and 5. Epileptic deterioration. There is some
question as to whether the various psychic epilepsies, so
called, are sufficiently clear-cut to constitute clinical
entities.</p>

<p>The delimitation of these psychoses for statistical purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
is described in the Association's manual as
<span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"In addition to the epileptic deterioration, transitory
psychoses may occur which are usually characterized by
a clouded mental state followed by an amnesia for external
occurrences during the attack. (The hallucinatory
and dream-like experiences of the patient during the attack
may be vividly recalled.) Various automatic and
secondary states of consciousness may occur.</p>

<p>"According to the most prominent clinical features
the epileptic mental disorders should therefore be specified
as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"(a) Epileptic deterioration: A gradual development
of mental dullness, slowness of association and
thinking, impairment of memory, irritability or apathy.</p>

<p>"(b) Epileptic clouded states: Usually in the form
of dazed reactions with deep confusion, bewilderment and
anxiety or excitements with hallucinations, fears and violent
outbreaks; instead of fear there may be ecstatic
moods with religious exaltation.</p>

<p>"(c) Other epileptic types (to be specified)."</p>

<p class="p2">During a period of sixteen years in the New York state
hospitals (ending October 1, 1888) 3,167 of 84,152 admissions
were cases of "epilepsy with insanity." This meant
an admission rate of 3.76 per cent. It must be borne
in mind, however, that the differentiation between epilepsy
with insanity and psychoses clearly due to epilepsy
was not attempted at that time. During a subsequent
period of eight years in the same institutions, when what
is essentially the present classification was in use, the
admission rate for epileptic psychoses was 2.42 per cent.
In 1919 with 3,011 first admissions to the Massachusetts
state hospitals only fifty cases (1.66 per cent) were reported
as showing psychoses due to epilepsy. Six hundred
and twelve cases, constituting 3.33 per cent of 18,336<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
first admissions, were reported by twenty-one hospitals
in other states. An analysis of a total of 70,987 first admissions
in forty-eight state hospitals therefore showed
that 1,865, or 2.62 per cent, were epileptic psychoses.
After reading the statements contained in various textbooks
regarding the extraordinary frequency of epileptiform
seizures in dementia praecox, it is difficult to escape
the conclusion that the percentage of epileptics has been
underestimated rather than exaggerated.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHONEUROSES AND NEUROSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The words neurosis, psychosis and psychoneurosis are
of obscure origin and have had a varied significance from
time to time. Murray<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> defines psychosis as a psychological
term indicating "a change in the psychic state;
an activity or movement of the psychic organism, as distinguished
from neurosis" which he speaks of as a
"change in the nerve-cells of the brain prior to, and resulting
in, psychic activity." Huxley in discussing this
subject in 1871 made the following differentiation: "In
all intellectual operations we have to distinguish two sets
of successive changes&mdash;one in the physical basis of consciousness
and the other in consciousness itself; one set
which may, and doubtless will, in course of time, be followed
through all its complexities by the anatomist and
the physicist, and one of which only the man can have
immediate knowledge. As it is very necessary to keep a
clear distinction between these two processes, let the one
be called neurosis and the other psychosis."</p>

<p>Von Feuchtersleben used the latter word in its present
psychiatric significance in his "Lehrbuch der Aertzlichen
Seelenkunde" in 1845. Its repeated appearance
in the first volume of the <i>Allgemeine a Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie</i>
in 1844 would strongly suggest a frequent use of
the term in the German psychiatry of that day. It was
unknown in English works until quite recently, although
the word is found in Maudsley's "Responsibility in Mental
Diseases" (1874)&mdash;"No wonder that the criminal psychosis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
which is the mental side of the neurosis, is for
the most part an intractable malady, punishment being
of no avail to produce reformation." Lewes, in "The
Problems of Life and Mind" published after his death in
1879, makes a very significant remark: "Pathologists
call it a psychosis, as if it were a lesion of the unknown
psyche." Clouston's 1911 edition makes no reference
to psychoneuroses as such.</p>

<p>The word neurosis has been much more extensively
employed in medical literature. William Cullen, a well-known
professor in the University of Edinburgh, in his
"First Lines of the Practice of Physic" in 1774, said:
"I propose to comprehend, under the title of neuroses,
all those preternatural affections of sense or motion
which are without pyrexia, as a part of the primary disease."
In his "Synopsis Nosologicae Medicae" in 1785
he divided diseases into four general classes: Pyrexia
or febrile diseases; neuroses or nervous diseases, as
epilepsy; cachexiae or diseases resulting from bad habit
of the body, as scurvy; and locales, or local disease, as
cancer. Brachet,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> who was one of the earlier writers
on the subject of hysteria, defined that disease in the
following words in 1847: "Hysteria is a neurosis of the
cerebral nervous system, which manifests itself more or
less brusquely by crises of general chronic convulsions
and by the sensation of a globe ascending in the course of
the oesophagus, at the upper extremity of which it becomes
fixed, causing there a menace of suffocation."
Briquet, another French writer, expressed somewhat similar
views in 1859. The word neurosis as now used may
be said to refer to a functional disturbance of the nervous
system, which, if directly due to etiological mental
factors, is spoken of as a psychoneuroses.</p>

<p>Just what diseases are to be included under the grouping
of neuroses and psychoneuroses is another question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Practically all of the older authorities, at least, have
agreed on hysteria and neurasthenia. When we get beyond
this point, however, there are wide differences of
opinion. Oppenheim, in his second edition, under the
heading of neuroses, included hysteria, hypnotism and
hypnosis, neurasthenia, morbid fears, imperative ideas,
astasia-abasia, traumatic neuroses, hemicrania, headache,
vertigo, epilepsy, eclampsia, chorea minor, Huntington's
disease, paralysis agitans and many other conditions.</p>

<p>Krafft-Ebing<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> was responsible for the following
delimitation of the psychoneuroses, which he admits to be
"somewhat dogmatic" and has used for many years
largely for didactic purposes: "1. Parasitic, accidentally
acquired diseases in individuals whose cerebral functions
were previously normal and whose disease could not
be foreseen. 2. Disease based upon temporary disposition
(grave physical disease and the simultaneous action
of powerful exciting causes), hereditary predisposition
not excluded, but only latently present in the brain of
one easily affected, but previously normal in its functions.
3. Tendency to cure of the disease and infrequency
of relapses. 4. Slight tendency to transmission
to descendants, and when it occurs, in benign forms (psychoneuroses).
5. Typic course of the disease picture.
Mania, as a rule, arises from a melancholic initial stage;
and so-called secondary conditions are the terminations
of primary conditions. The disease picture, even when it
appears, has a certain duration and independence. The
whole course of the disease is quite narrowly limited in
time, and goes on either to recovery or dementia. 6. No
tendency to periodicity of the attacks or the grouping of
symptoms. 7. Sanity and insanity are sharply defined,
and in striking contrast." In this group he includes
mania, melancholia, acute curable dementia and primary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
hallucinatory delirium. He describes hysteria, neurasthenia,
etc., under the psychic degenerations with paranoia
and speaks of them as constitutional neuroses. His
psychoneuroses certainly do not come within the general
acceptation of the term at this time but represent the
views of a certain school of German writers.</p>

<p>More recently the words neurosis and psychoneurosis
have been used as synonymous terms by many writers.
Kempf has even gone so far as to suggest discarding the
word psychosis completely. In any event, the view that
we should only designate as psychoneuroses such functional
conditions as are clearly due to psychic causes
seems to be gaining ground. The term neurosis is generally
applied at this time to diseases primarily physical
rather than mental in their symptomatology. The prominence
of psychogenic factors has been given great weight
in recent literature. In the second edition of his work
on Psychiatry, Diefendorf makes the following statement:
"Neuroses are commonly designated as a group of diseases
characterized by changing and transitory nervous
disturbances, to be distinguished from psychoses by the
fact that the symptoms do not involve the mental field.
But in practice psychoses without nervous symptoms or
neuroses without mental symptoms are not encountered."</p>

<p>Since the term was first introduced by Morel in 1860,
many French writers, such as Régis and Magnan, have
emphasized the importance of the insanity of degeneracy.
This included moral insanity, the sexual perversions
and various other psychopathic conditions as well as the
obsessions, compulsions, impulsions, phobias, doubts, etc.,
now recognized as psychogenic in origin and usually assigned
collectively to the psychoneuroses under the designation
of psychasthenia. In his sixth edition Kraepelin
included both hysteria and epilepsy in his group of neuroses,
while constitutional peculiarities of character, as
well as compulsive and impulsive insanity with sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
perversions, were classified under the psychopathic states
(degenerative insanity). In his seventh edition epilepsy
was described as a separate entity. In the eighth edition
we find a new grouping. The psychogenic conditions are
divided into nervous exhaustion (neurasthenia), the
dread neuroses, induced insanity, the paranoid conditions
of the deaf, the traumatic neuroses, the prison and the
"querulant" psychoses. Hysteria now appears separately.
Under the constitutional psychopathic disorders
he discusses nervousness, compulsion neuroses, impulsive
insanity and the sexual perversions. In view of these
varying conceptions which are fairly representative of
the literature of the day, we are certainly on safe ground
in confining a consideration of the psychoneuroses to hysteria,
neurasthenia, psychasthenia and various other conditions
characterized by anxiety and fears.</p>

<p>Hysteria has long been a subject of interest and controversy.
It has been a topic of discussion since the time
of Esquirol and even Sydenham. It was studied exhaustively
by Brachet in 1847. Briquet in 1859 defined hysteria
as "an encephalic neurosis whose apparent phenomena
consist principally in the perturbation of the
vital actions which serve to manifest the affective sensations
and passions." Lasègue wrote an elaborate treatise
on the subject in 1864. It was discussed in detail later
by Möbius, Charcot and many others. To Möbius hysteria
was "a congenital morbid mental state where diseased
bodily conditions are produced by ideas." During
the last twenty or thirty years many new and interesting
theories have been advanced. Binet sees in hysteria
a condition of double consciousness, the two states almost
entirely independent and separated by periods of amnesia.
Janet's<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> interesting conception of the disease
is covered in full in his definition: "Hysteria is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
mental disease belonging to the large group of the diseases
due to weakness, to cerebral exhaustion; it has only
rather vague physical symptoms, consisting especially in
a general diminution of nutrition; it is above all characterized
by moral symptoms, the principal one being
a weakness of the faculty of psychological synthesis, an
abulia, a contraction of the field of consciousness manifesting
itself in a particular way; a certain number of
elementary phenomena, sensations and images, cease to
be perceived and appear suppressed by the personal perception;
the result is a tendency to a complete and permanent
division of the personality, to the formation of
several groups independent of each other; these systems
of psychological factors alternate, some in the wake
of others, or coexist; in fine, this lack of synthesis favors
the formation of certain parasitic ideas which develop
completely and in isolation under the shelter of the control
of the personal consciousness and which manifest
themselves by the most varied disturbances, apparently
only physical." He summarized this as a complete doubling
(dédoublement&mdash;literally undoubling, as translated
by Corson) of the personality. On analysis there is fundamentally
much in this view strongly suggestive of the
theories of Breuer and Freud.</p>

<p>Babinski interprets hysteria as a purely psychic functional
disturbance due to suggestion. He would eliminate
from this field all symptoms which cannot be induced by
suggestion and relieved by methods of persuasion. The
ordinary physical manifestations of the disease, such as
anesthesia, hyperesthesia, paralyses, convulsions, etc.,
Babinski describes as stigmata. His theories lead him to
suggest "pithiatism" as the correct name for hysteria.</p>

<p>A revolutionary and epochmaking contribution to the
literature of this important subject was the publication
of their "Studien über Hysterie" by Breuer and Freud
in 1895. The latter has made various further expositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
of his views more recently. What the ultimate outcome
of the hysteria problem may be, only time can determine.
No consideration of the subject, however, is
complete, nor should any definite conclusions be attempted,
without a thorough understanding of theories
which have a material bearing on the mental mechanisms
involved in all of the psychoneuroses. Breuer and Freud
advanced the suggestion that hysteria is always the result
of a psychic trauma. The mechanisms involved may be
very briefly summarized. Studies of everyday life show
that the peculiar amnesia often observed for certain
names and events does not mean usually in the average
individual a mere fading of memory with the lapse of
time. Freud found that the inability to recall things in
such cases is largely due to the fact that they are for
some reason or other unpleasant in nature and therefore
not desirable to remember. They are accordingly pushed
into the background as it were, by burying them in the
subconscious strata of the mind and intentionally obliterating
them from memory. When the ordinary well balanced
individual is confronted with an unpleasant situation
he meets it as best he can, by the exhibition of normal
reactions of various sorts. He treats the matter
lightly, dismisses it as a joke or "laughs it off." His dignity
may be maintained by a display of anger or resentment.
The mental equilibrium may be restored by a resort
to profanity, tears, violence, or even physical flight.
An emotional outlet in the form of hate or thoughts of
revenge may be necessary to settle the question and finally
dispose of it by "getting it off the mind." There are
unpleasant situations which for various reasons cannot
be met and treated in this ordinary way. The mental
shock of the "psychic trauma" may, for instance, be the
result of an occurrence which is so distasteful and repulsive
as to be incompatible with the present existence.
There being no other escape from such a difficulty, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
rejected by the psychic censor, to use Freud's expression,
and repressed or forced into the subconscious. This is
the inadequate reaction which takes place in hysteria and
leads to a dissociation and rudimentary splitting of the
consciousness. Freud finds that in practically every instance
the repressed and painful idea is due to a psychic
trauma resulting from some incident of a sexual nature;
furthermore, that it usually dates back to the time of
childhood. These buried sexual complexes are completely
disposed of by what Freud speaks of as the process of
"conversion," the associated affect being radiated, as it
were, into the physical sphere where it is converted into a
memory symbol in the form of an hysterical symptom.
The mental symptoms of the disease he explains as the
results of the elaboration and development of hypnoid
states or erotic day-dreams of the individual. Freud<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
summarized his views in a series of formulae "which
strive to progressively exhaust the nature of hysteria"
as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"1. The hysterical symptom is the memory symbol
of certain efficacious (traumatic) impressions and experience.</p>

<p>"2. The hysterical symptom is the compensation by
conversion for the associative return of the traumatic experience.</p>

<p>"3. The hysterical symptom&mdash;like all other psychic
formations&mdash;is the expression of a wish realization.</p>

<p>"4. The hysterical symptom is the realization of an
unconscious fancy serving as a wish fulfilment.</p>

<p>"5. The hysterical symptom serves as a sexual gratification,
and represents a part of the sexual life of the
individual (corresponding to one of the components of
his sexual impulse).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>
<p>"6. The hysterical symptom, in a fashion, corresponds
to the return of the sexual gratification which was real
in infantile life but had been repressed since then.</p>

<p>"7. The hysterical symptom results as a compromise
between two opposing affects or impulse incitements, one
of which strives to bring to realization a partial impulse,
or a component of the sexual constitution, while the
other strives to suppress the same.</p>

<p>"8. The hysterical symptom may undertake the representation
of diverse unconscious nonsexual incitements,
but can not lack the sexual significance."</p>

<p class="p10">The practical application of these theories of Freud is
illustrated by the line of treatment suggested. By his
method of "catharsis" the repressed and forgotten painful
idea is restored to the conscious sphere of the mind
and a normal reaction brought about by "affording an
outlet to the strangulated affect through speech." To
accomplish this result it is obviously necessary to find
out what the psychic trauma was that originally caused
the repression. For this purpose he uses psychoanalysis,
hypnosis and the study of dreams. Psychoanalysis is
nothing more or less, as Campbell says, than a sort of
"scientific confessional", a complete analysis of the mental
mechanisms of the individual in a search for the buried
complexes. It has largely been preferred by Freud to
hypnosis, the latter often being impracticable for various
reasons. The association test of Sommer was very successfully
adapted to the determination and explanation
of buried complexes by Jung. Freud's views as to the
analysis of dreams in the unravelling of mental mechanisms
are set forth in full in his "Traumdeutung" (1900).
He describes a dream as being "the more or less disguised
fulfilment of a suppressed wish." Owing to the
activities of the psychic censor we may have either manifest
or latent dreams. The former are recalled on waking;
the latter are distorted or forgotten and indicate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
repressed wish. He classifies dreams as, those which
represent an unexpressed wish as being fulfilled, those
which represent the realization of the wish in some
entirely concealed form and those which represent
it in a form insufficiently or partly concealed. Freud
justified his emphasis of the sexual element in his
studies of the psychoneuroses by the publication
of his "Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie." In
this he calls attention to the neglected importance of
sexual factors in the developing mentality of the child
and shows that these influences are manifested long before
the age of puberty. He even maintains that the normal
child is homosexual as well as incestuous at a certain
stage. These erotic impulses are largely unconscious and
become submerged, playing an important part later in
the development of the neuroses.</p>

<p>Kraepelin has devoted one hundred and sixty pages
of his work on psychiatry to a consideration of the subject
of hysteria. The mental symptoms of the disease
are all described as being definitely associated with twilight
or dream states (Dämmerzustände). These he
refers to as including somnambulisms, definite excitements,
attacks assuming a characteristic silly or "puerile"
form, confusions, deliria of various kinds, the Ganser
complex, prison stupors and double personalities (retrograde
amnesia). He does not accept Freud's views
as to the influence of the sexual life in the etiology of
hysteria.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia was first described by Beard of New
York in 1880. As has already been shown, it was referred
to by Kraepelin as one of the psychogenic neuroses.
Freud is much inclined to question the existence
of such an entity as the classic neurasthenia described
by Beard. He feels that most of the cases can be traced
to a definite association with some other psychosis. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
does, however, recognize a neurasthenic complex which is
entirely sexual in origin and attributes it to the excessive
masturbation of adult life. The symptoms, according to
Freud, are a result of the inadequate sexual relief afforded
by the habit, and are those of nervous exhaustion,
a sense of pressure or fulness in the head, spinal irritation,
hyperesthesias, paresthesias, diminished sexual
power, and occasionally a mild form of emotional depression.
He would also differentiate another psychoneurosis
of sexual origin&mdash;the anxiety neurosis (Angstneurose).
He mentions an increased irritability as a prominent
symptom often in the form of an oversensitiveness to
noises. The characteristic feature, however, is a state
of anxious expectation. This may manifest itself in a
mere uneasiness and general tendency towards pessimism
or may approach a state of hypochondriasis with paresthesia
and annoying somatic sensations. Fear of sudden
death may be experienced. There may be physical
symptoms such as disturbed heart action (palpitation or
tachycardia), disturbance of respiration (dyspnea or
asthmatic attacks), profuse perspiration, periods of trembling,
dizziness, attacks of inordinate appetite, diarrhea,
etc. Nocturnal frights are common. The symptoms as
outlined above are accompanied by a marked anxiety.
He finds anxious psychoses usually in women, in the
form of virginal fears in adults, the anxiety of the newly
married, similar states occurring in widows or intentional
abstainers, and fears occurring at the climacterium. This
condition in women he believes to be due as a rule to coitus
interruptus or ejaculatio praecox. Similar anxieties in
men, according to Freud, are due to abstinence, frustrated
sexual excitement, coitus interruptus or senile
conditions. Masturbation may also be a factor. He also
admits that there are causes other than sexual, in the
form of overwork, serious illnesses, etc. The mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
mechanism involved is a "deviation of the somatic sexual
excitement from the psychic, and in the abnormal
utilization of this excitement occasioned by the former."</p>

<p>In 1903 Janet formulated his conception of psychasthenia,
describing it as a clinical entity. In this grouping
he included the obsessions of doubt, phobias, imperative
ideas, impulsive obsessions, compulsions and other conditions
described by various authors. The essential mechanism
to be considered, according to Janet, is a "lowering
of the psychological tension." This results, as White
expresses it, in an inadequate perception of the realities
of the outside world. Meyer has spoken of psychasthenia
as "a lowering of general interest and tendency to rumination
over what is accessible to the patient in his memory,
but is not squarely met, and where the normal reaction
is replaced by rumination, substitutive acts and
panics." These conditions are described by Freud as
belonging to the "Zwangsneurose" or compulsion neuroses.
The obsessing ideas force themselves into the consciousness
of the individual, who is perfectly clear as to
their inconsistency but cannot escape them. These he
also looks upon as being of sexual origin and due to repression
as in hysteria. After the unpleasant idea is
repressed, however, the mechanism is different. Instead
of converting the concept into a bodily symbol, a defense
reaction displaces the affect from the painful thought,
connecting it with some entirely disinterested and innocuous
idea. This process he spoke of as substitution.
This transference, as in hysteria, takes place in the subconscious
and is not recognized by the patient as having
anything to do with his peculiar symptoms. Compulsive
ideas prevent the recurrence in thought, of the repressed
etiological factor. It must be conceded that these mechanisms
are exceedingly interesting from a psychological
point of view. Freud's theories have, however, met with
a great deal of opposition, due apparently to the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
all of his conceptions are based almost exclusively on the
influence of the sexual life on the human mind. The
characteristic and entirely consistent Freudian answer to
this objection is that it is a "defense reaction." Without
attempting to determine the exact basis of the psychoneuroses
the fact remains that their importance from a
psychiatric point of view cannot be questioned. They
constitute in a large measure the field of observation
covered by the out-patient clinics and psychopathic hospitals.
They played an exceedingly important part in
the psychiatry of the late war.</p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration the mental mechanisms
involved, the American Psychiatric Association has endeavored
to collect statistical data relating to the various
psychoneuroses generally recognized, as is shown by
the suggestions regarding their delimitation, in the
<span class="no-break">manual:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The psychoneurosis group includes those disorders
in which mental forces or ideas of which the subject is
either aware (conscious) or unaware (unconscious) bring
about various mental and physical symptoms; in other
words these disorders are essentially psychogenic in
nature.</p>

<p>"The term neurosis is now generally used synonymously
with psychoneurosis, although it has been applied
to certain disorders in which, while the symptoms are
both mental and physical, the primary cause is thought
to be essentially physical. In most instances, however,
both psychogenic and physical causes are operative and
we can assign only a relative weight to the one or the
other.</p>

<p>"The following types are sufficiently well defined clinically
to be specified:</p>

<p>"(a) Hysterical type: Episodic mental attacks in
the form of delirium, stupor or dream states during which
repressed wishes, mental conflicts or emotional experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
detached from ordinary consciousness break
through and temporarily dominate the mind. The attack
is followed by partial or complete amnesia. Various
physical disturbances (sensory and motor) occur in hysteria,
and these represent a conversion of the affect of
the repressed disturbing complexes into bodily symptoms
or, according to another formulation, there is a dissociation
of consciousness relating to some physical function.</p>

<p>"(b) Psychasthenic type: This includes the compulsive
and obsessional neuroses of some writers. The main
clinical characteristics are phobias, obsessions, morbid
doubts and impulsions, feelings of insufficiency, nervous
tension and anxiety. Episodes of marked depression
and agitation may occur. There is no disturbance of consciousness
or amnesia as in hysteria.</p>

<p>"(c) Neurasthenic type: This should designate the
fatigue neuroses in which physical as well as mental
causes evidently figure; characterized essentially by mental
and motor fatigability and irritability; also various
hyperesthesias and paresthesias; hypochondriasis and
varying degrees of depression.</p>

<p>"(d) Anxiety neuroses: A clinical type in which
morbid anxiety or fear is the most prominent feature.
A general nervous irritability (or excitability) is regularly
associated with the anxious expectation or dread;
in addition there are numerous physical symptoms which
may be regarded as the bodily accompaniments of fear,
particularly cardiac and vasomotor disturbances; the
heart's action is increased, often there is irregularity and
palpitation; there may be sweating, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, suffocative feelings, dizziness, trembling, shaking,
difficulty in locomotion, etc. Fluctuations occur in
the intensity of the symptoms, and acute exacerbations
constituting the "anxiety attack."</p>

<p>"(e) Other types."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The psychoneuroses occur very infrequently in institutions
for mental diseases. In 49,640 first admissions to
the New York state hospitals during a period of eight
years, only 671 cases were reported as neuroses or psychoneuroses,
constituting 1.35 per cent of the total. Of
this number 29.97 per cent were of the hysterical type,
37.35 of the psychasthenic, 30.27 of the neurasthenic form,
and 2.41 per cent were anxiety psychoses. In the Massachusetts
hospitals during the year 1919, thirty-six, or
1.19 per cent, of the 3,011 admissions reported were neuroses
or psychoneuroses. Of these, 44.83 per cent were
of the hysterical, 24.14 of the psychasthenic, and 18.39 per
cent of the neurasthenic forms. On analyzing 18,336
admissions to twenty-one hospitals in other states we
find 297 cases of neurosis or psychoneuroses, 1.63
per cent of the total. Of these, 44.11 per cent were
cases of hysteria, 28.28 of psychasthenia, 22.90 of neurasthenia
and 4.71 per cent of anxiety psychoses. The
neuroses or psychoneuroses constituted 1.42 per cent of
over seventy thousand admissions to all institutions. Of
the 1,048 psychoneuroses reported, 35.20 per cent were
cases of hysteria, 33.68 of psychasthenia, 29.19 of neurasthenia,
and 3.91 per cent of anxiety psychoses.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH PSYCHOPATHIC
PERSONALITY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The introduction of the term psychopathic personality
is probably to be attributed to the description of
"Die Psychische Minderwertigkeiten" by Koch in 1893.
These were referred to by Morel<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> as "Psychopathic
Depreciations," a group in which he says Koch included
"a very large number of these psychical manifestations,
so varied in their nature and intensity which, without belonging
to the class of mental diseases proper, cannot,
nevertheless, be reconciled with the idea of perfect mental
sanity." These were described as being either congenital
or acquired and including psychopathic predisposition,
psychopathic defect and degeneration. To congenital defects
were attributed the "Eccentrics, disequilebrated,
overscrupulous and capricious persons, foolish, misanthropes,
redressers of wrong, reformers of society, etc."
In the degenerative processes he included mental deficiencies
both intellectual and moral. Meyer,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> who
based his conception of "constitutional inferiority"
largely on the work of Koch, says that the latter by
"Psychische Minderwertigkeiten" "meant those little
defects which constitute the inferiority of the individual
in the whole strife of life, that inferiority which does not
allow him to come up to an actually efficient balance in
the struggle of life.... They were oddities, peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
nicks in the personalities of the various people, and he
designated those as constitutionally inferior." Koch in
this grouping unfortunately included hysteria, psychasthenia
and neurasthenia. Meyer eliminated these: "I
wanted to do justice to the hysterias and psychasthenias
which I could define as such, but I knew there was a
whole group of cases in which the definition could not
be pushed. I also knew that it was difficult to give the
definition in the downward line towards imbecility, and
since it was so very hard to give the definition in the individual
cases, I thought that the least trouble would
arise from making a relatively large group of 'inferiorities
not sufficiently differentiated' and let those be entered
under the heading of 'constitutional inferiority.'"</p>

<p>The original conception of this group was that it included
intellectual defects which have subsequently been
classified with the mental deficiencies, leaving only those
cases showing purely psychopathic taints of a constitutional
origin. There have been numerous other descriptions
of these conditions. Ziehen<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> included under the
psychopathic constitution "chronic, psychopathic conditions,
which in their symptomatology and course not only
involve defect of the affectivity but also of the intelligence,
even though pronounced psychopathic symptoms,
such as delusions, hallucinations, etc., do not intrude for
any extended period. Where hallucinations and analogous
symptoms do appear they are solitary and the patient
retains insight into the condition." Ziehen's psychopathic
constitution covers a very wide field, including
not only hysteria and neurasthenia but epilepsy.</p>

<p>The psychopathic personalities as described today
represent only a modern interpretation of conditions
which have been given ample consideration in the psychiatric
literature of the past. An early illustration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
this fact is Pritchard's definition of "moral insanity"
in 1835:&mdash;"A morbid perversion of the feelings, affections
and active powers, without any illusion or erroneous
conviction impressed upon the understanding; it sometimes
coexists with an apparently unimpaired state of
intellectual faculties." The psychopathic states were undoubtedly
fully covered in Morel's description of the
insanity of degeneracy in 1860. This he divided into
cases arising from constitutional nervous temperaments,
moral insanity, the feebleminded with or without morbid
impulses, and those with criminal tendencies. This conception
was well summarized by <span class="no-break">Diefendorf
<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>:&mdash;</span>"The
disharmony of the intellectual and the moral faculties is
one of the most striking features of degeneracy. As in
the defects of the intellectual development, so in the
moral sphere, the condition varies from a complete arrest
of moral development to all forms of moral perversion
and even to an abnormal development of the moral
and emotional susceptibility. All of these conditions may
exist, with a perfect development of the intellectual faculties....
The professional criminals should also, without
doubt, be included in this class, as they present all
possible varieties of moral perversions and anomalies,
all of which may exist with preservation of the intellect
and even with intellectual keenness."</p>

<p>Magnan described compulsions, impulsions and contrary
sexual instincts as episodes of the insanity of degeneracy.
The psychopaths were undoubtedly the "déséquilibrés"
or ill-balanced individuals of Régis,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> whose
work on "Mental Medicine" included an exceedingly
elaborate discussion of the so-called "borderline"
conditions. "After maturity they are complex beings,
heterogeneous, made up of disproportioned elements, contradictory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
qualities and defects, and as over-endowed in
some directions as they are deficient in others. Intellectually,
they often possess in a very high degree, the
faculties of imagination, of invention, and of expression,
that is to say, the gifts of speech, the arts, and poetry;
on the moral side, they possess a singular emotivity, or
rather, sensibility. What they lack, more or less completely,
is good judgment, the moral sense, and especially
continuity or logical consecutiveness, a unity of direction
in intellectual production and the actions of life. It
follows, that in spite of their often superior qualities,
these persons are incapable of conducting themselves in a
rational manner, of following regularly the exercise of a
profession that seems well beneath their capacity, of looking
after their interests or those of their families, of carrying
on business prosperously or of directing the education
of their children; their existence, therefore, constantly
recommencing, is one long contradiction between
the apparent wealth of means and poverty of results.
They are the utopians, the theorists, the dreamers, who
are enamored with the best things but accomplish nothing.
The public which sees only the brilliant exterior
looks upon these individuals as artists and superior beings.
The medal is reversed, however, to those who are
compelled to associate with them and share their existence;
they see their defects, their incapacities and evil
tendencies, of which they are not merely the witnesses,
but also the victims. Aside from their lack of mental poise
these individuals also display an excessive emotional sensibility
and an enfeeblement of psychic energy that reveals
itself by a noticeable predominance of spontaneity
over reflection and volition. Hence their inability, their
instability, and their irresolution; hence also their alternations
of apathy and activity, of excitement and torpor,
their violent attacks of passion and their cries of despair
for the most trivial and slightest reasons." Régis divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
the "psychic discordances" or disharmonies into the ill-balanced,
the original and the eccentric. These were all
included in the degeneracies of evolution. Clouston covers
this same ground fully and in a somewhat similar
manner in his "Unsoundness of Mind" (1911).</p>

<p>The insanities of degeneracy have also been given considerable
space by such Italian writers as Lombroso, Bianchi,
etc. Lombroso in "The Man of Genius" (1888)
discussed this subject as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>"A theory, which has
for some years flourished in the psychiatric world, admits
that a large proportion of mental and physical affections
are the result of degeneration, of the action, that is, of
heredity in the children of the inebriate, the syphilitic,
the insane, the consumptive, etc.; or of accidental causes,
such as lesions of the head or the action of mercury,
which profoundly change the tissues, perpetuate neuroses
or other diseases in the patient, and, which is worse, aggravate
them in his descendants, until the march of degeneration,
constantly growing more rapid and fatal, is
only stopped by complete idiocy or sterility. Alienists
have noted certain characteristics which very frequently,
though not constantly, accompany these fatal degenerations.
Such are, on the moral side, apathy, loss of moral
sense, frequent tendencies to impulsiveness or doubt,
psychical inequalities owing to the excess of some faculty
(memory, aesthetic taste, etc.) or defect of other qualities
(calculation, for example), exaggerated mutism or verbosity,
morbid vanity, excessive originality, and excessive
preoccupation with self, the tendency to put mystical interpretations
on the simplest facts, the abuse of symbolism
and of special words which are used as an almost exclusive
mode of expression."</p>

<p>Several other very elaborate works have been published
on the subject of degeneracy. One of the better
known of these perhaps is that of Max Nordau on "Degeneration"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
(1894). The book of Grasset<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> on the
"Demifous et Demiresponables" has been translated into
English and constitutes one of our most valuable contributions
on this subject. Grasset credits Trélat with
making the first comprehensive study of the semi-insane
in his "La Folie Lucide," etc., in 1861. His classification
of these conditions included imbeciles, the feebleminded,
satyrists, nymphomaniacs, monomaniacs, erotomaniacs,
jealous individuals, dipsomaniacs, spendthrifts, adventurers,
the conceited or boastful, evildoers, kleptomaniacs,
suicides and the inert and lucid manias. Grasset
gives some interesting illustrations of the psychopathic
traits of various men of genius. Tolstoï fell sixteen
feet as a result of attempting to fly when eight years
old, and whipped himself with ropes to become accustomed
to pain. In school he chose a course in Oriental languages
because everyone else was interested in law. Not
being able to finish a college career in two years, he decided
to go to a desert and live a purely animal life. It
was necessary for him to resort to devices of various
kinds to prevent suicide. Rousseau was at various times
a clockmaker, music master, painter and servant in addition
to studying medicine, music, theology, and botany.
He dedicated a pamphlet "to all Frenchmen who were
friends of justice" and distributed it on the streets. One
of his acts was to write a letter "to God Almighty" and
place it under the altar of Notre Dame. Persecutory
ideas were entertained by him for years. Emile Zola was
evidently a psychasthenic as well as a psychopath. He
counted the gas jets on the street, the numbers on the
doors, and the cabs passing by. These were added together.
"For a long time the multiples of three seemed
to him of good omen, then the multiples of seven were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
reassuring." "For a long time he was afraid he would
not succeed in any proceeding on which he was about to
enter if he did not leave the house with his left foot
first." Balzac had an ambulatory mania and could not be
found when called for military service. It is said that on
one occasion "when he had put on a handsome new dressing
gown he wanted to go out into the street with it on
with a lamp in his hand to excite the admiration of the
public." His father is said to have stayed in bed for
twenty years without any reason for so doing, suddenly
resuming his former mode of life at the end of that time.
Schopenhauer broke a hotel proprietor's arm because he
heard him talking outside of his room. He refused to
pay a legitimate account because his name was spelled
with two p's instead of one, on the bill. He often burned
his beard instead of shaving and wrote his notes in
Greek, Latin and Sanskrit for fear someone would read
them. In his will he left all of his possessions to soldiers
and to his dog. Goethe alternated between great joy and
extreme depression and had unjustifiable attacks of anger.
Frederick II had such a dislike for changing his coat
that he had only two or three during the course of his life.
When Schiller wanted to meditate he had a habit of putting
his feet on ice and sniffing the aroma of fermenting
apples. Nordau says "that Richard Wagner is accused
of having a greater degree of degeneracy than all the
degenerates that we have thus far seen put together."
Mozart played the harpsichord at three years of age,
composed concertos at five and made a concert tour at
the age of six. He was extremely nervous and fell in
love at fifteen with a girl of twenty-five. In the last
months of his life he was obsessed with the idea that he
had to prepare his own funeral mass. Lombroso's theory
is that "genius is a true degenerative psychosis, belonging
to the group of moral insanities which may temporarily
spring from other psychoses and take their form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
but always conserving certain special characteristics
which distinguish it from the others." Although his conclusions
may not be warranted it must be admitted that
many men of genius have been psychopaths.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> in discussing the influence of heredity
on psychoses and personalities, says, "Hence we may,
perhaps, discriminate between congenital states of disease
and morbid personalities, according as the disturbances
are apparently the expression of the morbid conditions
of past generations, or seem to be purely personal
abnormalities, although it is certainly impossible to make
any sharp distinction." In 1915, in the fourth volume of
his eighth edition, Kraepelin devoted nearly one hundred
and fifty pages to the subject of psychopathic personalities.
These he divides into the excitable, the
unstable, the impulsive, the eccentric, the liars and swindlers,
the antisocial or enemies of society, and the quarrelsome.</p>

<p>A study of the "excitable" psychopaths in Kraepelin's<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
clinic showed the intellectual standard of
these individuals to be above the average. Apprehension
and judgment were unimpaired even when mental inferiority
was not entirely lacking. Some complained of
poor memory or absentmindedness, others of a feeling of
fatigue. A definite mental activity was noted, usually of
a happy mood, but occasionally with depressive tendencies.
The characteristic feature was an emotional excitement,
associated often with violent rages, without any
adequate reason. The emotional reaction changed
quickly to one of despair, anxiety, irritability or inaccessibility.
The mood in a large number of cases was
depressed and tearful, while others were cheerful and
elated, laughing and joking, or erotic. Often without any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
apparent cause, irritability, pessimism, unsociability,
weariness of life and thoughts of suicide appeared&mdash;more
particularly during menstrual periods. The emotional
state as a rule was kind, affable, good-natured,
tractable, often religious, sensitive or sympathetic. The
patients are often spoken of as well-liked, industrious,
honest and substantial citizens. Some are timid, bashful
or gloomy in disposition. Others are conceited, overbearing,
tyrannical, rude, unsociable and quarrelsome. Many
are childish, foolish or eccentric, highstrung and affected
or untruthful. Some are unsteady, restless and over-occupied,
full of schemes, rash, talkative, gossiping, and
assuming striking mannerisms. Occasionally they are
disinclined to any regular occupation, neglect their work,
loaf around and are supported by their relatives. In
sixty-two per cent of these cases the patients were
brought to the clinic on account of suicidal tendencies.
This was due to reduced circumstances in nearly fifty
per cent of the men and in seventy-one per cent of the
women. In the men marital troubles and love affairs
were more common; sometimes loss of position, or death
in the family, etc. Spurious attempts at suicide of a
theatrical type were frequently reported. Next to suicidal
inclinations as a cause for being brought to the
clinic there were assaults, attacks of rage and outbursts
of despair. In any stress or anger over a disagreeable
occurrence these individuals are likely to become abusive,
shout, scream, run around, strike the head against the
wall, tear their clothes off, pull out their hair, etc. Some
rush around all night in the streets in a senseless rage,
improperly clothed. Occasionally they attack others unjustifiably
and for no apparent reason. They are exceedingly
susceptible to alcohol. During their excitements,
consciousness may be clouded. Afterwards they say they
were confused, not themselves, in a dream as it were,
etc. Some have no recollection whatever as to what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
done. These excitements rarely last more than a few
hours. Thirty-two per cent of the men and less than ten
per cent of the women were convicted of crime, usually
for disturbing the peace, or criminal assaults, but occasionally
for much more serious offenses. As a rule alcohol
is a factor in these cases. The relations between
the sexes are characterized by jealousy and quarreling.
The women are particularly likely to have delusions of
infidelity. Genuine hysterical attacks occur in a certain
number of cases. They often see visions and may have
dizzy spells or syncopes. Somnambulism may occur.
Nervous symptoms often appear&mdash;headaches, unpleasant
dreams, palpitations, tremors, increased reflexes, tics, etc.
The excitable cases constituted nearly one-third of the
psychopaths admitted at Kraepelin's clinic. Sixty per
cent of these were women. The majority of cases were
between fifteen and twenty-five years of age. Heredity
appeared to be a factor in forty-seven per cent and many
showed physical defects. Fifty per cent of the men were
intemperate.</p>

<p>The "unstable" psychopaths are characterized by a
dominating weakness of the will. In nearly one-half of
the cases the intellectual endowment is normal, some having
a surprising power of comprehension and ability to
take up new things, with accurate observation of their
surroundings and keen discrimination. These persons
have no great persistence and do not exert themselves, are
inattentive, tire easily and are distractible. They never
go into things deeply and have only a superficial knowledge
of events. They learn readily and forget quickly.
The memory is poor and unreliable. The imagination is
usually very active, with a tendency to exaggerate, dream
of the impossible and relate great stories. There is an
inclination to boast and fabricate, telling of wonderful
but wholly imaginary deeds and accomplishments. They
often represent themselves to be important personages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
Some show artistic talent, write plays or fantastic
poetry and discuss literary and dramatic problems. They
are strongly inclined to become actors. The higher intellectual
development is uniformly defective. Comprehension
is not clear and judgment is immature and short-sighted.
Their interests are devoted to frivolous matters
without much attention to more important questions.
They sometimes show great prospects in school but do
not fulfill them later. The mood is cheerful and conceited,
with a very high opinion of themselves and great
ambitions. They blame their relatives for their lack of
success and claim they are not understood or appreciated.
Sometimes the emotional trend is more sad and gloomy.
They complain of being unlucky, everything goes wrong.
Occasionally anxieties appear, with a feeling of oppression,
fear of being alone, of mental troubles or suicide.
These feelings are, however, superficial in character,
usually disappearing in a short time, to be followed by
excitement, outbursts of anger or anxiety. They are
often quarrelsome. The characteristic disturbance, however,
is that of the will. They are entirely lacking in the
capacity to stick to any one occupation. They are not
punctual, are interfered with in innumerable ways and
often change their work, looking for something more suitable.
Hypochondriacal notions hamper their activities.
Senseless journeys and trips are often undertaken.
Some become vagabonds and tramps. They are much inclined
to bad company and resort to immoderate use of
tea, coffee, drugs and alcohol. Sixty-four per cent of
Kraepelin's male cases and twenty per cent of the women
were intemperate. The sexual habits are very often irregular
and venereal diseases to be expected. Kraepelin
found either gonorrhea or syphilis in twenty-two
per cent of the women examined. Some exhibited homosexual
tendencies. Many become spendthrifts, making
extravagant and foolish purchases. They are inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
speculate unwisely. Fifty-four per cent of the men and
nearly a third of the women as a result of their moral
deterioration come into conflict with the courts on account
of thefts, assaults, quarrels, vagrancy, etc. Suicidal tendencies
were shown in forty-eight per cent of the men
and sixty-five per cent of the women in Kraepelin's clinic.
In many cases these were induced by alcoholism, in other
instances by family quarrels, etc. Often the reasons
given were foolish. Hysterical attacks appear in a certain
percentage of cases in the women. Some had hallucinations
and confusional attacks or syncopes. Tremors,
headaches, increased reflexes and other neurological
symptoms occasionally appeared. The "unstable" group
included about one-fifth of the psychopaths observed by
Kraepelin. Thirty-six per cent of these were women.
The majority of those admitted were between the ages of
fifteen and twenty-five. Heredity was a factor in forty-nine
per cent of the cases.</p>

<p>The "impulsive" psychopaths are characterized by a
domination of the conduct by emotional impulses. The
intellectual makeup of these individuals is usually good.
They often have a special bent for art, music, poetry, etc.
They frequently show a considerable mental activity and
versatility. They express themselves well, make witty
remarks and appear brilliant, although they may complain
of absentmindedness or fatigability. They are always
conceited, born to greater things and have a great
future. There is an almost unbounded egotism in some
cases. The emotional tone is good-natured, easygoing
and accessible. Many are sensitive and visionary; others
obstinate, inconsiderate, pretentious or quarrelsome. The
mood is usually high-spirited and confident but variable.
The patients are often depressed and hopeless, complaining
of their luck. At other times they are sullen, surly,
irritable and faultfinding. Many exhibit suicidal tendencies.
An emotional irritability is exceedingly common,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
with violent outbursts of anger. Often they refuse to
associate with others for a time and will speak to no one.
The three common types are the spendthrift, the wanderer
and the dipsomaniac. The spendthrifts usually indulge
in alcohol and naturally soon contract enormous
debts. They frequently have little insight into their condition
or blame someone else for it. Many become wanderers
and go aimlessly from one place to another&mdash;wherever
their inclination leads them. The memory for
these events is good. Some inadequate reason is always
offered. These wanderers usually are children between
the ages of ten and fifteen. The impulsive alcoholics may
have attacks very rarely, sometimes only once a year.
Debauches are preceded by restless and moody conduct.
After constant drinking for days or weeks they sometimes
have suicidal impulses. Sexual excitements may
occur. They always show psychopathic traits between
attacks. They are unsteady, unreliable, make sudden
resolutions, change their occupations and residence and
lead a wild existence with surprising adventures. Some
have hysterical attacks, fainting spells, or even convulsions.
The impulsive psychopaths constituted only two
or three per cent of Kraepelin's cases. Practically all
were over twenty-five years of age. There was a hereditary
taint in seventy-one per cent of the cases.</p>

<p>The "eccentric" psychopaths are characterized by a
lack of uniformity and consistency in the mental makeup.
The intellectual endowment of these individuals is usually
normal. They are often absentminded, forgetful and
show a variation in productivity. Some are artists or
devote themselves to inventions. Judgment is impaired
and reasoning becomes distorted and onesided. There
is a tendency towards exaggeration and extravagance in
their viewpoints, with a leaning towards queer notions.
They are often quickwitted, versatile and write long and
wordy documents. Their mode of expression is bombastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
and labored, and the content of speech or writing, verbose,
desultory, flighty and full of meaningless expressions.
They show a certain shrewdness and cunning,
dissimulate, resort to all kinds of evasions, and are conspicuous
in their conduct. Occasionally there is a tendency
towards delusional ideas of a mild form. As a rule
the mood is cheerful, although often depressed, suspicious
or irritable. They are opinionated, boastful and better
than others. Usually there is an emotional excitability.
The patients are sensitive and irritated by small things,
scold and complain. Sometimes they are sentimental and
dreamy, with extravagant language. They often take sudden
dislikes to brothers, sisters or other members of the
family. They are capricious, quarrelsome, and faultfinding.
Their conduct is aimless, contrary and incomprehensible.
They lose all capacity for judgment of real
conditions. They cannot proceed in any orderly way in
things which they are really fitted for. They do not stick
to anything long, changing plans and occupations frequently.
They often go about at night talking, arguing
and drinking. It is not unusual for them to quarrel with
their wives or even commit assaults. The majority of
these eccentric psychopaths were men over thirty-five and
of degenerate families. This group constitutes only a
small number of cases.</p>

<p>The "liars and swindlers" are characterized by an
excitability of the imaginative faculties and a variable
and uncertain will power. At first these individuals are
likely to appear as unusually gifted persons. They are
good-natured, present an excellent appearance and are
apparently well informed on almost all subjects. They
have a faculty for quoting foreign languages and sometimes
are familiar with many tongues. Often they are
brilliant conversationalists. On investigation their actual
knowledge is found to be very superficial. They are inclined
to art, poetry and literature. Many become interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
in hypnotism or spiritualism. They are inclined
to join religious sects or attach themselves to the Salvation
Army. These individuals learn quickly but do not
stick to things long. Their mental powers are not orderly
or consistent. They have an extraordinary imagination
but accomplish nothing. They are liars from
birth, the falsifications usually being entirely useless.
Many are anonymous letter writers. They are often unable
to discriminate, themselves, between the true and the
false in their own stories. These fabrications appear to
be an emotional product, the imaginary occurrence practically
always relating to the individual himself. They
boast of their superiority in literary and scientific accomplishments
and claim to be theologians, mathematicians,
jurists, chemists, etc. In their imaginations and fabrications
the patients always better themselves. In many
instances they assume pretentious titles, represent themselves
as counts, princes, etc. Sometimes they strongly
suggest paranoia. In a small number of cases self-accusations
appear and they confess to all kinds of imaginary
crimes. As a rule they are elated and optimistic, but
often affected and theatrical. Occasionally suicidal attempts
are made. At times general depressions or
anxious states appear. Some are coarse and deceitful.
They are usually uncertain and capricious in everything.
Some become spendthrifts. They are naturally cheats
and swindlers; occasionally thieves. The swindling
schemes resorted to are innumerable. The use of false
names and assuming of uniforms and titles of various
kinds is the most common. They make purchases of all
kinds without any ability to pay or any intention of doing
so. Many refuse to pay bills without any excuse whatever.
Others attempt to marry rich women by deceitful
means and misrepresentations. Some practice medicine
without a license; others claim damages for imaginary
injuries. Sexual offenses are common. If arrested they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
are often inclined to claim amnesia for the period of time
when the act was committed. They occasionally have
genuine psychoses and hysterical attacks. These simulate
various diseases. The group of liars and swindlers
constituted from six to seven per cent of the psychopaths
in Kraepelin's clinic. Seventy-one per cent of the men
were accused of crimes. The majority of cases were
under twenty-five years of age. Heredity was a very important
factor.</p>

<p>The "antisocial" psychopaths or enemies of society
are characterized by a blunting of the moral elements of
their makeup and a lack of adjustment to their environment.
Kraepelin found that forty per cent of his cases
were persons who had done well in school. They have a
strong dislike for regular occupations and avoid them in
every possible way. Their behavior is variable, with a
tendency to be industrious occasionally and more often
lazy. Frequently they appear queer, abstracted, inattentive,
dreamy, sleepy or dull. When at their best they
are not bright mentally and have no ambition or far
reaching interest. They learn quickly and forget as
rapidly. Their store of knowledge is very limited. They
have no capacity for going into things thoroughly and
cannot acquire a higher education. They are lacking in
judgment, foresight and discrimination. Many have a
weakness for cheap stories of adventure, pictures of
crime, etc. In expression they are usually quick as well
as verbose. A characteristic is their lack of truthfulness.
They are liars and braggarts. The mood is usually cheerful
and confident; sometimes arrogant, surly, moody, irritable
and occasionally depressed or anxious. They
change unexpectedly from one mood to the other. Irritability,
with outbursts of anger, is common. They often
become threatening and destructive. Eighteen per cent
of Kraepelin's cases attempted suicide. At least one-third
of these were theatrical attempts on account of fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
of punishment. Childish vanity and conceit is a very
common symptom, with boastful tendencies. A prominent
feature is the lack of any deep emotional reactions. They
do not react normally and properly to their surroundings.
Another characteristic defect is their entire lack
of sympathy for anyone else. They are likely to be cruel
to animals as well as persons. They show little affection
for parents, children or relatives and are lacking in a
sense of decency and personal cleanliness. As children
they are exceedingly troublesome in school. Some have
to go to custodial institutions for care. Many are truants
at school and run away from home, becoming wanderers
and vagabonds. They are inclined to sexual excitement,
irregularities and crimes of various sorts. Seventy per
cent of Kraepelin's cases were thieves, beginning to steal
as children; twenty per cent were embezzlers and twelve
per cent guilty of fraud or forgery. Practically every
variety of crime was represented. They exhibit an extraordinary
tendency to revert to criminal habits. Prison
life makes some submissive but starts others in a war
against society. They often attempt violence or make
passive resistance to the law. They occasionally develop
hypochondriacal tendencies. Friendly advances are
greeted with mistrust. Some are stubborn, sulky, unrepentant
and have nothing to say, or lie and explain by
putting the blame on others. Thus an opposition to all
organized society develops. They often look upon themselves
as martyrs. Others take the situation lightly and
minimize the gravity of their position. Some seem to
really see the error of their ways. The antisocial individuals
sooner or later, like other psychopaths, are very
prone to hysterical attacks, fainting spells, or even convulsions.
Anesthesias and hyperesthesias may be noted.
Some patients complain of headache, disturbed sleep,
dreams, etc. The antisocial in Kraepelin's clinic constituted
less than ten per cent of the psychopaths, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
seventy per cent were men. Half of the women were prostitutes.
Over eighty per cent of the cases were under
twenty years of age.</p>

<p>The intellectual makeup of the "quarrelsome" psychopath
is usually fairly good. As a rule these persons
show a narrowing of the intellectual sphere, with, however,
a well-defined shrewdness which enables them to
take advantage of others. Some show a tendency to
pedantry and hair-splitting arguments. Memory is good
but distorted by an emotional coloring. Judgment is
warped and unreliable. They are credulous and accept
statements without proof, but they look with suspicion on
anything not in accord with their own ideas. The influence
of these factors leads to an emotional excitability.
They are always passionate, sensitive individuals who
become excited over trivial matters. This is complicated
by a marked self-confidence, minimizing their own failings.
Quarrels are the inevitable consequence. Everything
is exaggerated in importance. The conclusion is
reached that the neighbors and others are all organized
against them. Sometimes the feeling of enmity is transferred
from one individual to another. The patient is
constantly in trouble with someone. They are almost
invariably of the male sex and usually of middle age or
older when they come under observation.</p>

<p>For statistical purposes the differentiation of the psychopathic
personalities has been described by the Association's
committee as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Under the designation of psychopathic personality
is brought together a large group of pathological personalities
whose abnormality of makeup is expressed
mainly in the character and intensity of their emotional
and volitional reactions. To meet the demands of current
usage, the term for this group has been shortened
from the older one "psychoses with constitutional psychopathic
inferiority" with which it is synonymous. Individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
with an intellectual defect (feeblemindedness)
are not to be included in this group.</p>

<p>"Several of the preceding groups, in fact all of the so-called
constitutional psychoses, manic-depressive, dementia
praecox, paranoia, psychoneuroses, etc., may be
considered as arising on a basis of psychopathic inferiority
or constitution because the previous mental makeup
in these conditions shows more or less clearly abnormalities
in the emotional and volitional spheres. These reactions
are apparently related to special forms of psychopathic
makeup now fairly well differentiated, and the
associated psychoses also have their own distinctive
features.</p>

<p>"There remain, however, various other less well differentiated
types of psychopathic personalities, and in
these the psychotic reactions (psychoses) also differ from
those already specified in the preceding groups.</p>

<p>"It is these less well differentiated types of emotional
and volitional deviation which are to be designated, at
least for statistical purposes, as psychopathic personality.
The type of behavior disorder, the social reactions,
the trends of interests, etc., which psychopathic personalities
may show give special features to many cases,
<i>e.g.</i>, criminal traits, moral deficiency, tramp life, sexual
perversions and various temperamental peculiarities.</p>

<p>"The pronounced mental disturbances or psychoses
which develop in psychopathic personalities and bring
about their commitment are varied in their clinical form
and are usually of an episodic character. Most frequent
are attacks of irritability, excitement, depression, paranoid
episodes, transient confused states, etc. True
prison psychoses belong in this group.</p>

<p>"In accordance with the standpoint developed above,
a psychopathic personality with a manic-depressive attack
should be classed in the manic-depressive group, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
likewise a psychopathic personality with a schizophrenic
psychosis should go in the dementia praecox group.</p>

<p>"Psychopathic personalities without an episodic mental
attack or any psychotic symptoms should be placed in
the <em>without psychosis</em> group under the appropriate subheading."</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are no statistics which show the
incidence of psychopathic personalities in the community.
A study of 70,987 first admissions to state hospitals shows
that the psychoses associated with this condition constituted
only 1.12 per cent of the total number. On the
other hand, the reports of the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic
show an admission rate for psychopaths of over six per
cent during a five-year period. When they reach a state
hospital it is usually owing to the development of manic-depressive
insanity or some other well-defined psychosis.
The important and troublesome cases from a social point
of view are those that do not reach hospitals. A much
larger percentage is to be found in institutions of the correctional
and penal type. There is no greater problem
today than the attitude of the state towards the psychopathic
criminal. The influence of these individuals on the
community at large is something that we have no means
of estimating at the present time.</p>

<span class="st">THE PSYCHOSES WITH MENTAL DEFICIENCY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The literature of mental deficiency is almost as old as
that of medicine. Imbecility was studied at some length
by Plato and Galen and was recognized by Felix Plater,
who has been accredited with the first classification of
mental diseases known (seventeenth century). Fitzherbert<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
in his "Natura Brevium" in 1652 included the
following interesting definition of idiocy: "He that shall
be said to be a sot and idiot from his birth, is such a person
who cannot count or number twenty pence, nor tell
who was his father or mother, nor how old he is, so as
it may appear that he hath no understanding or reason
what shall be for his profit, or what for his loss; but,
if he have sufficient understanding to know and understand
his letters, and to read by teaching or information,
then it seems he is not an idiot." One of the first medical
writers to discuss mental defects at any length was
Esquirol. In differentiating them from mental diseases
he said: "Idiocy is not a disease, but a condition in which
the intellectual faculties are never manifested; or have
never been developed sufficiently to enable the idiot to
acquire such an amount of knowledge as persons of his
own age, and placed in similar circumstances with himself,
are capable of receiving. Idiocy commences with life,
or at that age which precedes the development of the
intellectual and affective faculties, which are from the
first, what they are doomed to be during the whole period
of existence." ... "A man in a state of Dementia is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
deprived of advantages which he formerly enjoyed. He
was a rich man, who has become poor. The idiot, on the
contrary, has always been in a state of want and misery."
An elaborate treatise on the subject of cretinism
was published by Fodéré in 1792.</p>

<p>Tredgold,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> in discussing the etiology of mental deficiency,
divides the causes into factors indicative of, or
producing, a variation of the germ plasm and those acting
directly upon the offspring. The former include neuropathic
inheritance, alcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis,
consanguinity and the age of the parents. Among the
latter are abnormal mental and physical conditions of the
mother during pregnancy, or injury to the fœtus; abnormalities
of labor, primogeniture and premature delivery;
and after birth&mdash;traumatic, toxic, convulsive and
nutritional factors. He found neuropathic inheritance in
over eighty per cent of the cases studied. In 64.5 per
cent the heredity took the form of mental defects, insanity
or epilepsy, and in eighteen per cent paralysis, cerebral
hemorrhage, neuroses of various kinds, or psychoses.
There was a history of alcoholism in 46.5 per cent of the
series investigated. Tuberculosis occurred in the families
of thirty-four per cent, syphilis in 2.5 per cent, consanguinity
in five per cent, and a marked disparity in the
ages of the parents in four per cent. Factors acting
directly on the offspring, either before, during or after
birth, were found to be present in sixty-five per cent.
Goddard<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> in a study of 327 cases found a history of
inherited mental deficiency in fifty-four per cent, probable
heredity in 11.3 per cent, neuropathic ancestry in twelve
per cent, accidents of various kinds in nineteen per cent,
and no ascertainable cause of any kind in 2.6 per cent of
the total number.</p>

<p>The definition of a feebleminded person, proposed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
the Royal College of Physicians of London, and subsequently
adopted by the English Royal Commission, reads
as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>"One who is capable of earning a living
under favorable circumstances, but is incapable, from
mental defect existing from birth, or from an early age,
(a) of competing on equal terms with his normal fellows;
or (b) of managing himself and his affairs with ordinary
prudence." The English Mental Deficiency Act of 1913
included the following <span class="no-break">definition:&mdash;</span>"Persons in whose
case there exists from birth or from an early age mental
defectiveness not amounting to imbecility, yet so pronounced
that they require care, supervision, and control
for their own protection or for the protection of others,
or, in the case of children, that they, by reason of such
defectiveness, appear to be permanently incapable of
receiving proper benefit from the instruction in ordinary
schools." It will be noted that imbeciles and idiots do
not come within the scope of these definitions. This is
due to the fact that the term feeblemindedness as used in
England includes only the High Grade Amentia of Tredgold
or the Morons as defined by Goddard. The classification
of the latter is as follows:</p>

<p>1. High Grade Morons&mdash;Those that can do fairly complicated
work, with only occasional or no supervision, run
simple machinery or take care of animals, but are unable
to plan.</p>

<p>2. Middle Grade&mdash;Those capable of doing routine institution
work only.</p>

<p>3. Low Grade&mdash;Those who are only capable of running
errands, doing light work, making beds, scrubbing or
caring for rooms&mdash;if there is no great complexity of
furniture.</p>

<p>Tredgold describes imbecility as Medium Grade
Amentia and idiocy as Low Grade Amentia.</p>

<p>The Mental Deficiency Act of England defines idiots
as "persons so deeply defective in mind from birth, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
from an early age, as to be unable to guard themselves
against common physical dangers." It also refers to
moral imbeciles as "persons who from an early age display
some permanent mental defect coupled with strong
vicious or criminal propensities on which punishment
has had little or no deterrent effect." The imbecile as defined
by the Royal Commission of England is "one who
by reason of mental defect existing from birth or from
an early age is incapable of earning his own living, but
is capable of guarding himself against common physical
dangers."</p>

<p>Tredgold classifies either feeblemindedness, imbecility
or idiocy if due to pathological germinal variations
(caused by alcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis, etc., and
manifested by amentia, insanity, epilepsy, etc.) as being
either simple, microcephalic, or Mongolian. He describes
those which represent somatic modifications due
to gross cerebral lesions as syphilitic, amaurotic, hydrocephalic,
porencephalic, sclerotic, paralytic and other
toxic, inflammatory or vascular forms. The somatic
modifications due to defective cerebral nutrition he divides
into epilepsy, cretinism, nutritional forms and isolation
(sense deprivation).</p>

<p>The classification of mental defects used by Fernald
at the Massachusetts School for the Feebleminded and
based on mental ages is as <span class="no-break">follows:&mdash;</span>Idiot,&mdash;low grade,
less than one year; middle grade, one year or more; high
grade, two years. Imbecile,&mdash;low grade, three and four
years; middle grade, five years; high grade, six and
seven years. Moron,&mdash;low grade, eight and nine years;
middle grade, ten years; high grade, eleven and twelve
years. Fernald calls attention to the fact that the diagnosis
cannot be based on the mental age alone. The
intelligence quotient must be taken into consideration.
This is determined by dividing the mental by the physical
age. It is a comparison of the average intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
of the child, using the normal as a standard. The diagnosis
cannot be definitely made until the age of sixteen,
or until the probable mental age at sixteen is determined.</p>

<p>The following definitions are used by the American
Association for the Study of the <span class="no-break">Feebleminded:&mdash;</span>"An
idiot is a mentally defective person having a mental age
of not more than 35 months, or, if a child, an intelligence
quotient of less than 25. An imbecile is a mentally defective
person having a mental age between 36 months
and 83 months inclusive, or, if a child, an intelligence
quotient between 25 and 49. A moron is a mentally defective
person having a mental age between 84 months
and 144 months inclusive, or, if a child, an intelligence
quotient between 50 and 74."</p>

<p>Tredgold expresses the opinion that "the insanity of
the feebleminded and high grade imbeciles does not, on
the whole, differ from that occurring in ordinary persons."
In sixty-two cases under his observation he found
the following <span class="no-break">forms:&mdash;</span>Mania, thirty-two; melancholia,
sixteen; alternating mania and melancholia, six; stupor,
one; delusional insanity, one; and juvenile general paresis,
six. He also speaks of epileptic insanity and terminal
dementia in his cases.</p>

<p>Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> describes certain characteristics as applying
very generally to the mental deficiency group
which he prefers to speak of as "Oligophrenia." Sense
perception is often interfered with by defective vision,
opacities of the lens and cornea, errors of refraction,
optic atrophy or deafness. The apprehension of external
impressions may be prevented to a certain extent also by
disturbances of attention. Only the sharper and stronger
stimuli reach the patients as a rule and these impressions
are retarded. Many occurrences escape their notice entirely
and their sense perceptions are poor and scanty at
best. Disturbances of attention are shown by the attitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
facial expression, carriage and conduct, so that they
have an appearance of apathy and indifference when their
real feelings are entirely different. An increased effort
cannot be produced by an exertion of the will, nor can the
fatigue which such attempts result in, be overcome. Repeated
tests of various kinds show a marked decrease in
the power of apprehension. In profound idiocy it is
difficult to determine whether any impression can be made
on the sense organs or not. When the patients react to
a severe pin prick it is only after a considerable delay,
apprehension and attention being equally impaired.
Schlesinger found fifty-five per cent of his cases lacking
in interest, thirty-five per cent were distractible and ten
per cent showed an increased fatigability. An evidence
of the lack of attention is the fact that the weakminded as
a rule are not susceptible to hypnotism.</p>

<p>The apprehension of colors, form and dimensions is
uncertain and difficult. The patients learn to distinguish
colors very late usually. They can form no clear conception
as to the outlines, surface or contents of objects.
They have considerable difficulty in putting syllables and
sentences together. They recognize the details but not
the significance of pictures. In the elaboration of impressions
they are unable to distinguish between the real and
the accidental or nonessential. This gives rise to a confusion
of ideas. Changes in size, color, shape, etc, always
annoy them. Their lack of observation and discrimination
explains the absence of timidity in the presence
of strangers which characterizes normal children.
There is also a defective apprehension of auditory impressions
and they are unable to understand very familiar
sounds. Ley showed that they were often unable to identify
letters they heard pronounced. There is a marked
inability to grasp the meaning of ordinary words. The
sense of taste and smell is comparatively much less impaired.
Very defective children object at once to quinine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
when it is placed on the tongue. Nevertheless, many do
not notice unpleasant odors or even the taste of excreta,
etc.,&mdash;things which are exceedingly offensive to normal
individuals,&mdash;and are entirely indifferent as to the quality
of their food. Sensory disturbances of the skin are not
very marked. In a series of esthesiometric tests, however,
Ley obtained unsatisfactory "automatic" responses
in eighteen cases, meaningless answers in forty-eight, and
intelligent responses in eleven of 127 mental defectives
examined. The application of the sense of touch in
recognizing articles is acquired with difficulty. Pain
sensations are somewhat diminished also and some defectives
are apparently insensible to blows, etc. That the
sense of position and location is not well developed is
often shown by coarse, awkward movements. The sense
of weight and motion is lacking. Demoor found that the
feebleminded usually pointed out the larger article as
being the heavier even when lighter in weight. Claparede
found this characteristic present in one per cent of ninety-seven
pupils rejected as a result of mental tests, in eight
per cent of the mildly weakminded, and in sixty-five per
cent of the markedly defective cases. Memory is always
involved. Superficial impressions are easily lost.
Johnson subjected seventy-two defective children to retention
tests. Seventy could correctly repeat only three
numbers; sixty-six only four; fifty-one only five; twenty-seven
only six; fourteen only seven, and four only eight.
Ranchburg's tests showed them to be very susceptible to
suggestion. Some defectives, on the other hand, have a
peculiar faculty for remembering dates, numbers, performing
feats of arithmetic, etc. The memory defect is
usually shown more especially by the inability to take
advantage of the experience of the past. The patients
learn with difficulty, read little and forget what they are
taught. The events of life leave few traces and make
only a superficial impression on them. The intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
horizon for this reason is very limited. Their thoughts
are confined largely to the matter of clothing, food, etc.</p>

<p>The fundamental obstacle in the mental progress of
the defectives is the inadequate elaboration of general impressions
and conceptions. There is an absence of any
understanding of the importance of time, events, numbers,
etc. They often have no idea whatever as to the
significance of money. Dates mean nothing usually and
they are often unable to determine the time of day. The
train of thought as shown by tests made by Buccola is
delayed. Their poverty of thought is shown by the fact
that defective children can think of only about one-fourth
as many words during a given time as suggest themselves
to the normal child&mdash;a test suggested by Binet. Tests
reported by Sommer, Nathan, Binet and others show a
marked delay in association time and an impoverished
mental capacity. They frequently repeat the test word
or give entirely meaningless replies. Associations do
not become fixed on repeated tests as they do with normal
individuals (Wreschner). It is not easy for them to repeat
numbers, the months of the year or days of the week
backwards. They cannot supply omitted words or syllables
in sentences (Ebbinghaus test). It is hard for them
to assemble picture puzzles or pieces of cards. Revesz
found that it was more difficult for them to learn to
divide than to subtract or add. Multiplication he found
to be most easily acquired. They did not do well in tests
requiring any reason or judgment. They are entirely
incapable of defining or explaining abstract conceptions
of any kind. They cannot explain the meaning of fables
and have no appreciation of irony. Nor can they correct
the most obvious faults in test sentences. They have no
insight into their own condition and no grasp on either
past or present events. Their capacity for efficient occupation
and employment is much diminished. Their ability
to acquire an education is also limited. Of 286 cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
examined in school Schlesinger found only fifteen per
cent to be industrious in their habits. Nine per cent
failed in writing, eighteen in reading and twenty-four per
cent in arithmetic tests.</p>

<p>The emotional life is also much impoverished and unstable.
There is no sense of shame and no feeling of
family pride or patriotism. There is often a tendency
to commit criminal acts. As a rule the mood is indifferent
and apathetic&mdash;in strange surroundings they are
sometimes timid and anxious. Some feel ashamed of
their speech defects and awkwardness. Others show a
childish cheerfulness, or satisfaction and self-confidence.
There is a tendency to uncontrollable laughter, attacks
of anxiety, angry excitement, or childish despair with
hysterical manifestations which disappear quickly.
Usually the patients are inoffensive, manageable and well
behaved, but easily susceptible to bad influences. Often
they are queer, whimsical, capricious, obstinate and childish.
Henneberg, who examined a large series of cases,
described 33.8 per cent as anxious, timid, sensitive and
inclined to weep; 15.7 per cent as apathetic, dreamy, sluggish
and seclusive; 12.6 per cent as quiet, serious, good-natured,
sociable and pleasant; 18.7 as active, cheerful,
shallow, playful and talkative; and nineteen per cent as
rude, malicious, obstinate, irritable and bad-tempered.
The sexual life is sometimes undeveloped or may show
actual perversions. Bonhöffer found six idiots and fifty-three
feebleminded persons in an examination of 190
prostitutes. The volitional expressions of the defective
are very largely impulsive. They act without reflection
or regard to consequences and are easily induced to do
improper acts. The inhibition of will is shown by the
defective control of ordinary movements in responding to
commands. They are always slow in learning to walk.
The childish inability to perform finer and more precise
movements does not disappear later as it does in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
course of normal development. This is shown in their
gait, awkward movements, etc. Kraepelin interprets the
tendency to bedwetting as an evidence of volitional disturbance,
also the stereotyped, rhythmical movements of
the idiot. Laser found that forty per cent of his cases
had the habit of biting the finger nails.</p>

<p>Dependent upon the inhibition of volitional impulses,
two clinical groups of the feebleminded have been described
by Kraepelin,&mdash;the excitable and the apathetic or
dull. The excited forms are much more common. Schlesinger,
however, found thirty-one per cent of his cases
of the apathetic variety; twenty-nine per cent were excitable;
twenty-eight per cent had simple mental defects,
and the remainder showed antisocial tendencies. In the
apathetic or dull form there is a marked disturbance of
the attention; the patient takes no interest in his surroundings,
appears sluggish, awkward, emotionally dull,
and devoid of any voluntary impulse, often doing only
what he is urged to do. They are usually good-natured,
contented, and do simple work under direction, in a slow
and mechanical way. The lighter grades are of a dull,
weak-willed, readily influenced type. They are timid, unconcerned
and agreeable. The excitable variety, on the
other hand, show a purposeless, mercurial variability.
Their attention is easily distracted from one thing to another.
They cannot sit still, are restless and constantly
on the go. Occasionally they are violent.</p>

<p>The defective control of motor impulses by the will is
also shown in defectives by the disturbance of speech and
writing. Crailsheimer found speech disturbances in 36.3
per cent of his cases, Schlesinger in thirty per cent, and
Leubuscher in fifty per cent. They can often hear although
mute, sometimes recovering their speech during
an attack of excitement. Ley reported stammering in
twelve per cent of his cases and stuttering in thirteen per
cent. Agrammatism and akataphasia sometimes occur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
Word-blindness is also referred to as a symptom and
various disturbances of reading and writing have been
observed.</p>

<p>According to Kraepelin, the important developmental
landmarks in the life of the young are the acquisition of
speech (one year), the beginning of the school life (six
years), the appearance (fourteen years) and the completion
(eighteen years) of sexual development. The first
and second periods represent the relative levels of low
and high grade idiocy, the third imbecility and the fourth
feeblemindedness. This classification is somewhat similar
to that of Weygandt. The education ordinarily acquired
by the higher grade of the feebleminded is somewhat
limited. They may even excel in certain occasional
lines of work, for example, in music, art, etc. They are
usually poor in mathematics and lack interest and application
as a rule. Difficult apprehension and mental fatigability
are to be expected. They have to go over things
repeatedly, as their memory is not good. Their education
is often ample in some directions and very lacking in
others. Their judgment is onesided, their viewpoint narrow
and their worldly knowledge childish. What they
acquire at school is soon forgotten. They take no interest
in religion, politics or current events of importance,
and very impractical ideas are expressed on all questions.
The emotional manifestations vary. Some are agreeable,
cheerful, tractable; others timid, tenderhearted, sensitive,
slightly emotional or anxious. They are more likely to
be obstinate, stubborn, unruly, rude, irritable, unsociable
and violent-tempered. Some have periods of active excitement
and become threatening, abusive and violent.
Occasionally suicidal attempts are made, although they
are usually not genuine. Some are addicted to sexual
excesses, lying or swindling. Sexual perversions also
occur in some cases. They are usually incapable of any
continuous occupation and drift from one thing to another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
As a rule they have little conception of the value
of money and spend it recklessly. They are very susceptible
to alcoholism and often commit petty crimes.
Occasionally hysterical manifestations&mdash;syncopes, seizures,
etc.&mdash;appear. Clouded and confused states have
been observed. Frequently impulsive tendencies are
noted. In some instances psychopathic traits are very
striking. Excitable, unstable, impulsive, quarrelsome
and antisocial types appear as well as liars and swindlers.
Periodical excitements and depressions suggest manic-depressive
forms.</p>

<p>Considerable confusion has been occasioned by the
relation thought by some to exist between mental deficiency
and dementia praecox. Kraepelin<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> has spoken
of an engrafted hebephrenia, as shown by the following
quotation from his eighth <span class="no-break">edition:&mdash;</span>"I made the suggestion
a long time ago that certain, not very frequent, forms
of idiocy with well developed mannerisms and stereotypies
were an early expression of dementia praecox."
He is of the opinion that "the affected manners
of certain idiots, as well as the associated stereotypies
of attitude and movement in addition to the negativistic
impulses and the permanent obstinate inaccessibility
to all attempts at approach, show no relation
whatever to ordinary childish peculiarities and
belong on the contrary to the well-known picture
of dementia praecox." He interprets the "demenza
precocissima" of Sante de Sanctis and the "dementia
infantilis" of Heller as belonging to dementia praecox
rather than the mental deficiency group. He
further makes the suggestion that "weakmindedness existing
from youth without focal symptoms, and later leading
to deterioration, is as a rule to be looked upon as
pfropfhebephrenia, if epilepsy and cerebral syphilis can
be excluded, the former by the absence of seizures, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
latter by the results of the Wassermann reaction." Engrafted
hebephrenia or "pfropfhebephrenia" has been
studied by various observers. After an analysis of ten
cases Wasner reached the conclusion that feeblemindedness
predisposes to dementia praecox. Weygandt and
various other writers are not in accord with Kraepelin on
this subject. It is, however, generally conceded that the
occurrence of manic-depressive and other affective psychoses
in mental defectives is not at all infrequent.</p>

<p>As special types Kraepelin described microcephalic
varieties, the tuberous sclerosis of Hartdegen and
Bourneville (1880), vascular and other cerebral defects,
infantilismus, dysadenoid and other endocrine conditions,
Mongolian idiocy, hydrocephalus, encephalitic forms, etc.
Alzheimer, Hammarberg, and Bourneville have made
pathological classifications of the mental deficiencies.</p>

<p>Psychoses which render the commitment of mental
defectives to hospitals for mental diseases necessary are
comparatively infrequent, as is shown by statistics. In
the words of the statistical manual, "the most common
mental disturbances are episodes of excitement or irritability,
depressions, paranoid trends, hallucinatory attacks,
etc." Cases diagnosed as showing manic-depressive
psychoses or dementia praecox are not shown in the
mental defective group. Three and forty-eight hundredths
per cent of the admissions to the Massachusetts
hospitals during 1919 were diagnosed as psychoses with
mental deficiency. During a period of eight years the
admission rate to the New York hospitals amounted to
2.8 per cent. The admissions to twenty-one institutions
in other states constituted 4.33 per cent of the whole number
reported. In 70,987 admissions to forty-eight hospitals
in sixteen states the psychoses with mental deficiency
amounted to 3.22 per cent of all first admissions.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
